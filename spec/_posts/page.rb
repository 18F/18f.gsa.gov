A couple stars aligned to\nmake this one easy, but bottom line: it took 29 minutes to go from “How\ncould we do this?” to a working code integration that went live the same\nafternoon.\n\nI thought you should hear about what can happen when you get two simple,\nclean GSA codebases in a room together. This is what gets me excited\nabout working at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) every day!\n\nKudos especially to Sarah, Patrick and their team. In\n[m.gsa.gov](http://m.gsa.gov/) they've built something on a nice,\nflexible, modern architecture that's amenable to the same rapid\nprototyping and iteration that 18F is all about.\n",

The correct answer is D – [All of the\nabove.](https://18f.gsa.gov/)\n\n[18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) is a startup within GSA, encompassing the\n[Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://wh.gov/innovationfellows)\nprogram and a cutting edge digital delivery team. We’re doers, recruited\nfrom the most innovative corners of industry and the public sector, who\nare passionate about “hacking” bureaucracy to drive efficiency,\ntransparency, and savings for government agencies and the American\npeople.\n\n**But what do we actually do?**\n\n-   <span>Partner with agencies to deliver high quality in-house digital\n    services using agile methodologies pioneered by top technology\n    startups.</span>\n-   <span>Rapidly deploy working prototypes using [Lean Startup\n    principles](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) to get a desired\n    product into a customer’s hands faster.</span>\n-   <span>Offer digital tools and services that result in governmentwide\n    reuse and savings, allowing agencies to reinvest in their core\n    missions.</span>\n-   <span>We’re transparent about our work, develop [in the\n    open](https://github.com/18f), and commit to continuous\n    improvement.</span>\n\n**How do we do it?**\n\nFirst and foremost, by being focused on our users. We provide effective\nuser-centered services focused on the interaction between government and\nthe public it serves. At 18F, we want to build the 21st century\ngovernment you deserve.\n\nAgencies should see 18F as a new way to procure, build and deliver\ninnovative technology, digital services, and public-facing applications.\nWe operate using three models: for you, with you, or by you. We can\nbuild your solution for you; work with your team and provide additional\nexpertise or core capacity; or consult on how to build or buy\nuser-centric interfaces most effectively. 18F’s team of experts is here\nto help. After all, we all share the same goal of delivering incredible,\neasy-to-use digital services for the people and businesses we serve.\n\nOpen source code invites participation by talented and creative people,\nand we harness great open source projects in the service of our partner\nagencies. We use Agile Methods, the latest technologies, rapid\nprototyping, and great design to deliver our software. Our stack is\nmodern and flexible, using Python, Ruby, Node, WebFlow, SOLR,\nElasticSearch, NoSQL, and d3. Next month there may be something new —\nthe most important thing we’ve learned is to never stop learning.\n\n> *“It is not enough to adapt to today’s demands, we must anticipate the\n> changes that Americans expect from government.”*\n> Dan Tangherlini, Administrator, GSA\n\nLike lean startup, we favor experimentation, customer feedback and\nanalytics, and iterative design over a sequential “waterfall” model.\n([Read more about “Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything” in Harvard\nBusiness\nReview.](http://steveblank.com/2013/05/06/free-reprints-of-why-the-lean-startup-changes-everything/))\nIf startups and companies like General Electric can do it, why not the\nU.S. Government? Our goal with this approach is two-fold: build\nuser-centered digital services, and prove that building technology in an\nagile manner is possible in government at scale.
