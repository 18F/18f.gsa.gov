*Update: [The RFQ is live!](https://github.com/18F/ads-bpa/blob/18f-pages/assets/ADS%20RFQ%20Revised%20Modification%205.pdf)*

It’s game time. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the [Agile Delivery
Services Blanket Purchase Agreement (Agile Delivery
BPA)](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/08/creating-a-federal-marketplace-for-agile-delivery-services/)
is hitting the street on Wednesday, June 17, 2015. When the RFQ is
released, we will post it on GitHub and the General Service
Administration’s [eBuy
system (RFQ993471)](https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/advantage/ebuy/start_page.do), and
vendors will be able to submit responses to be part of the Agile
Delivery BPA.

As you’ll see in the RFQ, we are requiring vendors currently on
[GSA Schedule
70](http://gsa.gov/portal/content/104506) who want to be on the Agile
Delivery BPA to compete among three pools: a design pool (a total set
aside for small business), a development pool (also a total set aside
for small business), and a full-stack pool (unrestricted). When the
competition is completed, and awards are made, the vendors will be
working on 18F projects, for our internal needs, and for our partner
agencies.

Like we said before, we’re [doing things a little
differently](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/04/23/coming-soon-the-agile-delivery-services-soliciatation/)
in this procurement. We’re requiring vendors to submit a working
prototype based on a public dataset and show their work in a publicly
available git repository. We’re also requiring ourselves to adopt a
rigorous evaluation methodology to ensure that the vendors can meet our
needs.

[Read more about why this is important.](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/08/creating-a-federal-marketplace-for-agile-delivery-services/)

We’ve learned a lot through this process, which admittedly took us
longer than we expected. We learned from our partners within the General
Services Administration about how to improve the BPA, and we helped
educate them about how we work, and what we want our vendors to be able
to do. As a result, we have a better RFQ than we started with.

This sort of learning is part of our process. There’s a reason we are
describing the BPA in an *alpha* stage: we expect to continue to learn
and improve as we proceed.

In terms of next steps, vendors on Schedule 70 will submit their
prototypes and responses to the RFQ, GSA will review the responses, and
awards will be made. Stay tuned for more updates on this effort.

Finally, to the vendor community, if you want to participate in our
effort to transform the way the federal government delivers federal
digital services, here’s a piece of advice: [just ship
it](http://www.nps.gov/dena/learn/nature/images/as-2_5.jpg).
