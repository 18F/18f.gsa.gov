Designer Dan Brown was driving through downtown D.C. when he received a
nasty client voicemail. New to the city and in his mid-20s, Brown was
juggling multiple projects for the first time.

“I was scared,” he said.

When Brown reached out, the client vented. After that, something
surprising happened. Everything was fine; the client just wanted to be
heard. This was a small moment, but it stuck with Brown.

Over the course of his career, Brown has established himself as an
authority in design conflict and resolution. On Friday, he gave a talk
at 18F. “Stop fighting, start designing,” centered around the design
process and inherent conflict therein.

“Design *is* conflict,” Brown has said.

Brown, an information architect, has worked in the district for large swaths of
his career, both in private industry and the federal government, both
from his own home and in a dark, windowless office. Most recently, Brown
co-founded EightShapes, a design firm with clients like Yahoo! and
Marriott International. Across projects and situations, Brown noticed
many of the same conflicts cropping up.

He opened his lecture by listing common issues and stakeholder quotes.
For example, “Things have changed since we last spoke.”

Brown asked who in the audience had been told that before. After a
moment, a majority raised their hands. Conflict is a mechanism for
positive change, Brown explained. It’s a process, even though it feels
negative at times.

The designer and author of two books used his interactive game,
“Surviving Design Projects,” to frame sections of his afternoon lecture.
The game is a set of playing cards, which break conflict resolution into
three parts: situations, patterns, and traits.

During his talk, Brown asked audience members to draw “situation” cards
from the deck before discussing “pattern” card solutions. For example, a
distracted stakeholder fixates on an interesting but irrelevant website
for inspiration.

“I call it distracted by shiny objects,” Brown said, waving a laser
pointer around the room.

The pattern cards offer techniques for unsticking situations. For
example, “make a plan,” or “offer a sneak peek.”

The third piece of the puzzle, “trait” cards, are useful for
self-reflection and understanding characteristics. “Dogmatism,” for
example, can predict conflicts and the techniques that best resolve
them.

Brown asserted that no single, “right” solution exists; often the best
technique reaches outside comfort zones. He recounted a half-day
workshop where one participant used the same “pattern” for every issue.
The unvaried response led to an entirely new subset of conflict.

“You may look at some of the patterns and say, ‘I would not do that in a
million years,’” Brown said, but emphasized that experimentation can
move conflict in a new direction.

Brown challenged the audience to push themselves, to work toward shared
understanding, even if the process is frustrating or tense. And
self-reflection, he said, is invaluable.

"The crux of collaboration is understanding where you fit in, how you
contribute to the process.”
