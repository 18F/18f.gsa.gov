This month, the digital services family of U.S. Digital Services (USDS)
Headquarters, 18F, Presidential Innovation Fellows, General Services
Administration’s Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technology
(OCSIT), and more, got together at the [inaugural moveForward(100);
event](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/05/11/moveforward/) to share their
work. One of the projects 18F shared was the
[analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov) dashboard.

The dashboard collects web traffic data for participating federal
government websites and displays interesting information like the total
number of people on those websites right now and the top 20 most popular
pages.

Fitting with the moveForward(100); event, analytics.usa.gov was a
collaborative project between numerous offices including 18F, USDS,
OCSIT, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. As
noted in the video, the team put the site together in about three weeks,
but the data came from the GSA’s Digital Analytics Program, which has
been two years in the making.

Watch the video above to learn more about analytics.usa.gov from 18F’s
Leah Bannon and Charles Worthington of USDS or [learn more about how
the team built the
