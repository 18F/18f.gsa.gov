Improving collaboration and communication between an organization’s
development resources and its operational resources is the focus of an
upcoming conference co-sponsored by 18F and ACT-IAC.

Themed [*“Achieve Agile Nirvana Through DevOps,”*](https://actiac.org/groups/event/achieve-agile-nirvana-through-devops-512015) the education and
training event will be held from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Friday, May 1 at the
[*General Services
Administration*](http://gsa.gov/portal/category/100000), 1800 F Street
NW, in Washington, DC.

"DevOps is an IT solution development and implementation approach that promotes better collaboration and communication between an organization’s development resources and its operational resources," according to the [*ACT-IAC website*](https://actiac.org/groups/event/achieve-agile-nirvana-through-devops-512015). "This approach aims to provide increased quality and efficiency of the solution by focusing on the delivery of the entire 'service' targeted by the solution and not just one single software 'product.'”

The [*American Council for Technology (ACT) - Industry Advisory Council
(IAC)*](https://actiac.org/homepage) is a public-private partnership
devoted to improving government through information technology.
