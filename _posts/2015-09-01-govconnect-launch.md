We recently began our partnership with the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) on the [GovConnect
initiative](http://www.fedtechmagazine.com/article/2014/10/govconnect-makes-employee-passion-projects-reality),
which helps agencies create a culture of excellence based on
collaboration and teamwork.

To develop federal talent that can work and learn across boundaries, we
need new practices and technologies. GovConnect helps agencies test and
scale these approaches so we can build a 21st-century system that will
better respond to demands and handle cross-agency program and policy
challenges. It will do all this without the unnecessary limitation of
organizational silos by implementing a new model of a mobile, agile,
innovative, and skilled federal workforce. The OPM team, which includes
staff trained by the OPM Innovation Lab and Stanford’s d.school, will
develop this model in collaboration with other agencies.

18F signed onto this initiative to innovate the federal workforce, a
goal that complements the General Services Administration’s belief that
long-term success requires a strong, diverse, and optimized workforce.

We’re most well known for delivering digital services, which sometimes
leads people to believe our team is composed purely of technologists who
write code. However, some of our toughest challenges are understanding
the problems facing our agency partners and the people they seek to
positively impact. Thoroughly researching a problem can lead to new
approaches or the identification of existing solutions that can be
scaled or augmented with technology. Like OPM’s Innovation Lab, we
investigate problems with a human-centered design approach, starting
each project with a “discovery” phase to deeply understand how people
work, the challenges they face, and what their needs are.

The discovery phase includes a mix of face-to-face interviews, remote
collaboration, shadowing, and participatory workshops intended to engage
the user with the design problem. We do all this in collaboration with
our agency partners. Throughout discovery, design, and development, we
work to validate our assumptions by always including the people who will
use the services. We’re excited to work with OPM, which has been an
active leader of the federal “design thinking” community with their
Innovation Lab program.

The GovConnect initiative is a fascinating laboratory for research into
the challenges of developing and attracting talent in the federal
workforce. Our current government model was designed for a different
kind of work and predates current technology and management practices.
GovConnect is applying human-centered design methods to reframe the
experience of working and learning in the federal government.

## The story so far

One goal of
[President Obama’s second-term management agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/07/08/smarter-more-innovative-government-american-people)
is to improve the effectiveness of the federal workforce - a workforce
that makes up almost 3 million civilian employees across the world.
Reaching this goal will increase employee engagement, raise
productivity, and potentially attract a new generation of public
servants.

Several successful initiatives provided early proof of a new
collaborative model of workforce development: [Open Opportunities](http://www.digitalgov.gov/join-digitalgov/open-opportunities-in-digitalgov/)
(developed by GSA’s Office of Citizen Services and Innovative
Technologies),
the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) [Skills
Marketplace](http://www.fedmanager.com/news/2063-epa-professional-development),
the White House’s [Innovation
Toolkit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/12/02/designing-citizen-science-and-crowdsourcing-toolkit-federal-government),
and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's [Innovation
Time](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/engaging-new-employees-to-improve-huds-workplace-and-operations/2013/06/24/8d442838-dd20-11e2-bd83-e99e43c336ed_story.html).
Each of these efforts seek to tap the passion, energy, and ingenuity of
federal employees and allow people to develop their professional skills
by tackling problems that face federal agencies.

Thanks to the success of these initiatives and the passion of our
partners at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), GovConnect was
born. GovConnect is an agile workforce initiative sponsored by OPM and
co-led by EPA to encourage agencies to think differently about work, one
that develops and connects the federal workforce, encourages innovation,
and helps develop critical skills and build professional networks across
the government to where and when they’re needed. GovConnect is a network
of existing and new programs that seek to achieve this goal.

## GovConnect phase one

In April 2014, OPM's [call for
participation](https://www.chcoc.gov/content/govconnect-expo-follow-identifying-volunteer-pilot-agencies)
led to the selection of a cohort of pilot agencies to explore activating
their own workforce through new approaches to work. Based on interviews
with existing programs, the GovConnect team identified three models:

**GovProject** — Employees can develop professional skills and expertise
on a part-time basis (for example, up to 20 percent time) to support
project opportunities within the employee’s agency or in another
government agency. This model would also support the rapid deployment of
cross-agency tiger teams to respond to complex problems or
time-sensitive needs.

**GovStart** — Employees can work on innovative initiatives on a
part-time basis (for example, up to 20 percent time) and develop
professional networks within and across agencies. These micro-projects
are grassroots employee driven as opposed to management driven.

**GovCloud** — Employees are hired by one agency and are detailed out to
agencies on a project-by-project basis to address critical skills gaps.
GovCloud employees may work on one project at a time or work on multiple
projects at once.

For the past year, pilot agencies have made progress on diverse
initiatives. A GovConnect pilot does not require technology to get
started and could be as simple as a conference room with whiteboards and
sticky notes, or be driven by Google Forms and email, or include
postings on a pre-existing WordPress blog or SharePoint site.

In addition, some mentor programs have flourished. EPA’s Skills
Marketplace has become established within the EPA as an effective
resource for managers. Open Opportunities has grown dramatically and is
now open to all federal employees.

18F has developed the Midas software platform that fuels the Open
Opportunities program. We believe that many of the successful pilots
could be scaled with software and will use the research to improve the
Midas platform. However, the GovConnect primary researcher will work
separately from the Midas team and 18F is open to learning from their
research.

## What will 18F do?

18F researchers have already started connecting with pilot mentors,
pilot agencies, and private sector and nonprofit firms. The goal of this
research is to learn what patterns of success, and failure, might exist
and what have been the growing pains of successful initiatives. Initial
research will be conducted in the form of one-on-one interviews, as well
as reviewing metrics and other research already conducted by the
GovConnect teams. By working directly with agencies who are developing
pilots, have launched successful programs, or who have run into barriers
to adoption, 18F will take a human-centered approach to developing the
next step in the GovConnect solution.

The outcome of this discovery phase will be the production of a Starter
Kit with proven techniques from other agencies, including non-technical,
real-world approaches as well as technical solutions that can help
programs scale.
