Conventional wisdom often encourages engineers to start with a big
architectural overview. Services with databases are connected via lines
and arrows to other services. Caching layers, load balancers, and other
complex shapes are wedged into the flow of information. For tech savvy
people, these diagrams give some comfort that performance and security
are addressed. Non-tech people can point to the diagram with some
comfort that very smart people are doing very complex things.

Architectural plans provide comfort to everyone because they look like a
plan. The way forward is for the engineers to fill in servers and
infrastructure, making the map real.

Unfortunately, this kind of a grand plan usually leads to [technical-debt](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/05/managing-technical-debt/)
that collapses towards complete immobility. Complexities in even one of
these services can take down the entire project. Unknown problems at the
beginning can't be rolled into the new plan easily because all services
are dependent on this architectural contract.

In short, architectural plans push the team towards [waterfall
development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model#Criticism),
a system that has fallen out of favor as more and more projects have
failed.

## How can we avoid architectural handcuffs?

“Design” is an ambiguous word in the software world. On the one hand,
“design” is used to describe the graphical user experience. On the other
hand, engineering software “design” is the process of building small,
modular components that are decoupled. Both of these types of design are
essential for freeing a project from impending technical debt brought on
by an architecture-first plan. Here are some ways that focusing on user
experience design and software design can help your project avoid
technical debt.

## Starting from user stories and user experience

![A user story generating architecture organically.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/blog/design-over-architecture/user-story-architecture.jpg)
*A user story generating architecture organically.*

[User stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) are simple
scenarios told from the point of view of a person using the software.
There can be many types of users for an application. For example, an
application might have people consuming the application via a public web
page and others who are developers consuming it via an API. The
application may also need administrators to establish content or
permissions.

Formats for a user story are pretty simple:

> As a ***user of some kind*** , I want ***to see or do something*** , so that
> ***some benefit is had***.

In this story, you would fill in the bold sections with a user
type, a goal, and benefit. An application should start with tiny
scenarios like this that build functionality for each user. It’s the job
of the product or project manager to write these stories and prioritize
them.

Often teams are used to thinking in terms of architectural plans, and
the stories they have in mind are far too big. Instead of thinking of
one scenario for one user they are imagining the whole. This is an
example of a story that is too big and architecturally focused:

> As a website consumer, I want to be able to see all the publicly
> available information so that I will be informed about the services
> available.

A better first story would be something like this:

> As a website consumer, I want to be able to see a homepage with the
> agency logo so that I know I am at the right place

For teams used to thinking of architecture, this will seem like an
impossibly small story. Because it’s the first story, it will still
involve a lot of effort for the engineering team:

1.  Build a web application with a homepage and logo.
2.  Setup a staging server to make that website available to the product manager.
3.  Create a production server and [devops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) procedures for migrating from staging to production.

Subsequent stories will not require this much setup. A good second story
for an agency might be this:

> As a website consumer, I want to be able to see a list of projects so
> that I know what is happening in the agency.

With the infrastructure in place, this story will roll out much faster.
In this fictitious project stories might roll out like this:

-   As a website consumer, I want to see a page dedicated to each project in the projects list, in order to see more details about the project.
-   As a website consumer, I want to be able to navigate between project details pages and the project list, in order to move between important information quickly and easily.

Having finished a small set of stories about projects at the agency, the
product person might decide that the most important priority is showing
employee profiles so that the public can reach the people they need.
They would build out a cluster of small stories to accomplish all the
related goals.

After the team addresses lots of stories, driven by their top
priorities, the architecture will have evolved on its own. That can be
pretty dangerous if not also kept in check via the other side of the
design process, software design.

## Keeping our code from becoming a structureless mess

![Without good software design techniques, your code can become a mess as you fulfill more user stories.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/blog/design-over-architecture/messy-code.jpg)
*Without good software design techniques, your code can become a mess as you fulfill more user stories.*

Without a guiding architectural map, how does a team keep the code clean
and useful?

**This is where the second notion of “design” guides a project:**
[**software
design**](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.pdf).
You can think of software design as a discipline of keeping code small,
modular, and decoupled. Instead of a 20 line function, the engineer
breaks up functionality into six smaller methods that each play a little
part. Instead of every object knowing about every other object in the
application, objects are handed the things they need to accomplish their
tasks.

**If we think about these modules as bricks, then their independence and
flexibility makes it easy to construct almost anything: a retaining
wall, a house, a palace**. Smaller modules aggregate into bigger
modules. Groups of modules can become a service. User stories about
security and performance can build out all the shapes and lines in an
architectural diagram.

Focusing on software design turns the process of getting to architecture
on its head. Instead of drilling down from an architectural map into
services and code, we promote and organize code into an architecture.
There are two huge wins to this approach:

-   The abstractions were grown from the code and product itself and are a better fit than ones imposed from on high.
-   The modules of code are decoupled and can be rearranged when needs change.

## How to make great software designs

Seemingly since the dawn of programming, engineers have been concerned
with making code more modular and flexible. In that time, we have
developed great guiding principles.

### SOLID

[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))
is an acronym where each letter stands for a particular
[object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
design principle. Despite its object focus, SOLID has proven itself
useful across programming paradigms. Many have argued that SOLID can be
boiled down to its first principle: [*single
responsibility*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle).
This principle states that every module should have just one purpose.

To make this distinction more concrete, imagine an application being
created by an agency. The agency is connecting to data being created by
a non-governmental organization. This external organization has created
a great API that makes it easy for the agency’s engineers to get the
data they need. During the course of developing many user stories, the
engineering team realizes they have consumed data from that service in
three, slightly different ways.

They apply the single responsibility principle to make the design
better. They look at the three places that they’re connecting with the
API and see two patterns:

-   An authorization process has to be part of each request to the API.
-   The data coming back is parsed in very similar ways once received.

The agency engineers create an API client object that handles the
authorization. Then they create a parser that takes apart the data
consistently.

Wrapping up this logic in one place means that they’re inoculated from
massive changes, when they happen. When the non-governmental
organization decides to radically change the way they’re sending out
data, it changes in one place instead of three. When the agency connects
to their API in a number of other ways, and then the API changes their
authentication flow, that too changes in just one place.

The other SOLID principles, which I leave to your personal research, are
also concerned with reducing the cost of change by making code smaller
and simpler.

### Optimize for change, but don't optimize in advance

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>"The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry." — Robert Burns</strong></p>

Often when building software, we engineers are building something simple
and imagine that it will surely need more features soon. Being prudent,
we often choose to build those features now. Sometimes it’s a security
feature; sometimes performance; sometimes a more polished graphical
design.

As good as these intentions always are, the additions [make the code
complicated](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization) and hard to
work with. They lead to an increase in defects and reduced velocity.
These defects often decrease performance and security, in direct
opposition to their goals.

While it’s true that change is inevitable, optimizing for change
dictates that we keep things clean, simple, and decoupled.

When the desire to add optimizations arise the product team needs to be
an informed partner. They should make priority decisions and separate
concerns into new user stories.

### Commit to refactoring

The right abstractions for a growing, breathing software project cannot
be guessed correctly in advance. Trying to make that guess is the
“optimizing in advance” that we advise against. Instead, wait for
patterns to emerge and then refactor.

Martin Fowler introduced a helpful guide called the [rule of
three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)).
Duplicate code should be tolerated twice, but when a third instance is
needed, it’s time to refactor out an abstraction to remove that
duplication. This idiom may seem to stand at odds with the single
responsibility principle, but good design requires the right
abstractions, not just adherence to principles. It’s often impossible to
understand the real duplication when presented with only two examples.
Some teams I’ve worked with have required four examples to build the
right abstraction.

Software teams need to recognize that continual improvement leads to
much higher velocity in the short- and long-term. While changing to a
practice of continually refactoring initially impacts velocity, once
it’s part of the practice, everything works faster and better.

## There is still a place for architectural planning

User stories and good software design practices will grow architecture
organically.

There are a few decisions that still require us to think about
architecture first. Languages and frameworks have an impact on team
culture and the ability of the team to recruit top talent. Choose
languages and frameworks that are modern, open source, and
well-supported. Database technologies can be abstracted with adapter
layers, but it’s still important to carefully consider your needs and
the implications of your choices.

Breaking software into individual services allows multiple teams to work
on the same system at once. This optimization into services should
follow the successful implementation of many user stories that follow
user personas from end to end. This will make sure the system works as a
whole.

Focusing on design over architecture is a paradigm shift that forces
teams to think about the problem from the outside in. The win in this
approach is that there is no last minute integration step when a team
hopes that all the parts work together. Choosing design over
architecture wins by reducing project risk.
