Technology changes fast. People have grown to expect fast, personalized, and user-friendly information and services from the websites and apps they use on a daily basis. But with a shortage of in-house experts, budget limitations, and no quick way to purchase services, it can be hard for the Federal government to meet those same expectations. This is where we (and hopefully you) come in.

Built in the spirit of America's top tech startups, 18F is a consultancy and product delivery team **for** the U.S. Government **inside** the U.S. Government. We work with federal agencies to rapidly deploy tools and online services that are reusable, cut costs, and are easier for people and businesses to use.

We’re on a mission to transform the way government builds and buys digital services. We're currently working with more than a dozen different teams across the Federal Government to help them deliver on their missions in a user-centered way. We will accomplish this by:

* putting the needs of the American people first;
* being design-centric, agile, open, and data-driven; and
* deploying our products early and often.

We’re transforming government from the inside out, creating cultural change by working in partnership with teams inside government agencies who want to create great services for the American people.

Whether you’re near an 18F office in Washington DC, San Francisco, Chicago, or New York, or you’re closer to some of our teammates in Seattle, Portland, San Diego, Austin, Tucson, Dayton, Raleigh, or Philadelphia, we want to hear from you!

Our rapidly growing team is home to a variety of roles, including these:

## Software Development

Using modern, open-source web frameworks and tools, our front and back end developers work in small, cross-functional teams, close to user research and product prioritization, to produce functional, scalable web services.

## Infrastructure & Tools

Engineers work to provide developers at 18F (and across the government) with modern infrastructure services and fantastic tooling. Our engineers solve the most difficult problems between development and operations, whether that's debugging an application or architecting an environment. We work on automating everything, removing technical blockers, and constantly increasing everyone's capacity to deliver.

## Experience Design & Research

Our designers research user needs and communicate them to developers, product leads, and agency partners. They create research-based personas, understand information architecture, visualize scenarios, and design workflows based on user feedback.

## Visual & Interaction Design

Our designers create wireframes, HTML prototypes, high-fidelity mockups, and more, based on a firm understanding of user needs. They do what it takes to communicate (and sometimes implement) these solutions.

## Writing & Content Strategy

Sometimes called content designers, they assess current content needs, work closely with design researchers, and strategize with agency partners to write application copy, marketing collateral, editorial copy, and more.

## Product Management

Product Leads work closely with agency partners to define and prioritize product value in agile cycles. They remove blocks for the team, create and groom backlogs, champion user testing and ensure we are always shipping valuable code.

## Wildcard!

Not everyone fits into a predefined box. Cross-disciplinary innovators who are passionate about technology and improving the government experience are a big part of 18F.

## 18F is an Equal Opportunity Employer

We’re building a team that looks like the United States, and we don't discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information, age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service, or other non-merit factor. If you have the skills we need, that’s all that matters.
