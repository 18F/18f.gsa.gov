Today, we’re happy to announce the first open position on the new hiring page for the Technology Transformation Services (TTS). [JoinTTS](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/) will be the new home for all TTS job postings, including open 18F jobs.

Besides 18F, TTS is also home to an acquisitions team, the TTS Front Office, an operations group, the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, and the Office of Products and Platforms, which operates all kinds of helpful services like USA.gov and FedRAMP. The new JoinTTS page has more details about all these offices, timelines for what to expect when applying to TTS, and information about the interview and security clearance process.

The TTS Talent Team is preparing additional open positions, but today we’re looking for four product managers to work at 18F.

>As a Product Manager at 18F, you’ll lead cross-functional teams to deliver user-centered products using agile methodologies and modern software development practices while building capacity for product innovation in government. When you build products with a partner agency, you’ll coach them on modern product development practices so they’re set up for success in the long term.

If that sounds like you, [head over to JoinTTS to learn more and apply](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/join/product-manager-gs15/). We’re accepting applications only until Monday, February 26 at 11:59 p.m. ET, so hurry! Make sure you don’t miss an open job post by following [18F on Twitter](https://twitter.com/18f) and [subscribing to our newsletter](https://18f.gsa.gov/contact/#newsletter).
