Posting images on Twitter increases potential retweets by about 35%, according to [stats](https://blog.twitter.com/2014/what-fuels-a-tweets-engagement) published by Twitter. But posting images on Twitter raises interesting questions for accessibility; namely, there's no way to include alt-text in a Twitter image to capture what the image shows, which can be exclusionary for people with visual impairments or slow Internet connections.

We think a lot about accessibility at 18F. We want to make sure any images we post to Twitter are as accessible as the images we post to our website. Last week, we started trying something that we think will help make images in our tweets much more accessible. We started responding to our Tweets containing images, with another tweet explaining what the image shows. Here’s an example:

<img class="align-center" alt="Screenshot of tweet from 18F responding to tweet with description of image contained in first tweet" src="/assets/blog/twitter/twitter.png" />


Feedback from our audience was positive, and several people offered even more helpful suggestions on how we could improve our initial strategy. [@travelingheidi](https://twitter.com/travelingheidi/status/578569906834264064) suggested also including a link to the original Tweet in the response Tweet, which is a great idea (and will improve accessibility even more).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/18F">@18F</a> Since it doesn&#39;t work the same way in all apps, or if one goes back to earlier tweet days/months later can you link to earlier tweet.</p>&mdash; heidi heidi8 (@travelingheidi) <a href="https://twitter.com/travelingheidi/status/578569906834264064">March 19, 2015</a></blockquote>

[@kimberlymunoz](https://twitter.com/kimberlymunoz) suggested creating a second Twitter account to respond to any Tweets that include an image:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/18F">@18F</a> Would creating another account @18FImages to link + reply to tweets with descriptions be an option? It allows folks to turn it on/off.</p>&mdash; Kimberly Munoz (@kimberlymunoz) <a href="https://twitter.com/kimberlymunoz/status/578571119164264449">March 19, 2015</a></blockquote>

And [@thebenedict](https://twitter.com/thebenedict/status/578572813155590144) suggested creating an Inception-like experience for users, which is just funny and worth sharing:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/18F">@18F</a> Picture in tweet: screenshot of a tweet featuring a screenshot of a reply to a tweet featuring an image. <a href="http://t.co/PWUIJgubPd">pic.twitter.com/PWUIJgubPd</a></p>&mdash; thebenedict (@thebenedict) <a href="https://twitter.com/thebenedict/status/578572813155590144">March 19, 2015</a></blockquote>

Please let us know in [this GitHub thread](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/issues/648) if you have a suggestion or feedback on this approach, because we’d love to continue the discussion.

**Update**:

[Daniel Morgan](https://github.com/dsmorgan77) wrote and suggested that we add this link to a DigitalGov toolkit called [Improving the Accessibility of Social Media in Government](https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/improving-the-accessibility-of-social-media-in-government/). It's a must-read if you're interested in accessibility issues, and contains "helpful tips, real-life examples and best practices to ensure that your social media content is usable and accessible to all citizens, including those with disabilities."
