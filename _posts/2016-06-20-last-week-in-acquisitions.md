Every week, the 18F Acquisitions team is working to transform the way that the government buys digital services. Here are some snippets about what was on our minds last week about federal procurement!

* Shipping [working code](https://github.com/truetandem/fedramp-dashboard) beginning on day two of a federal contract, and [public project management](https://tree.taiga.io/project/truetandem-fedramp-dashboard) from day one!

* Cheering on the [successful delivery](https://github.com/18F/tock/pull/374) of a [micro-purchase](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/auctions/26), with the [assist of a vendor](https://github.com/18F/tock/pull/374#issuecomment-226189289) who did not win
