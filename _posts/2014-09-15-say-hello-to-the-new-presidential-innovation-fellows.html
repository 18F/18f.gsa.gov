  <p>We recently welcomed the newest group of Presidential Innovation Fellows into the federal government. This diverse group represents some of the nationâ€™s most talented and creative civic-minded innovators.</p>

  <p>More than a thousand candidates applied to serve the country in this unique capacity. From this pool of amazing and incredibly motivated applicants, we selected almost 30 designers, developers, entrepreneurs and executives to bring their unique skills into government.</p>
