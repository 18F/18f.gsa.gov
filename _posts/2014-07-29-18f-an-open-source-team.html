<p>At 18F, we place a premium on developing digital tools and services in the open. This means contributing our source code back to the community, actively repurposing our code across projects, and contributing back to the open source tools we use. For a variety of reasons, we believe that doing so improves the final product we create. It is because of this that <a href="https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md">our policy</a> is to:</p>

<!-- more -->

<ol><li><strong>Use free and open source software (FOSS) in our projects and to contribute back to the open source community;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Create an environment where any project can be developed in the open;</strong> and</li>
<li><strong>Publish all source code created or modified by 18F publicly.</strong></li>
</ol><p>FOSS is software that does not charge users a purchase or licensing fee for modifying or redistributing the source code. There are many benefits to using FOSS, including allowing for product customization and better interoperability between products. Citizen and consumer needs can change rapidly. FOSS allows us to modify software iteratively and to quickly change or experiment as needed.</p>

<p>Similarly, openly publishing our code creates cost-savings for the American people by producing a more secure, reusable product. Code that is available online for the public to inspect is open to a more rigorous review process that can assist in identifying flaws in the source code. Developing in the open, when appropriate, opens the project up to that review process earlier and allows for discussions to guide the direction of a products development. This creates a distinct advantage over proprietary software that undergoes a less diverse review and provides 18F with an opportunity to engage our stakeholders in ways that strengthen our work.</p>

<p>The use of open source software is not new in the federal government. Agencies have been using open source software for many years to great effect. What fewer agencies do is publish developed source code or develop in the open. When the Food and Drug Administration built out <a href="https://open.fda.gov">openFDA</a>, an API that lets you query adverse drug events, they did so in the open. Because the source code was being published online to the public, a volunteer was able to review the code and find an issue. The volunteer not only identified the issue, but provided a solution to the team that was accepted as a part of the final product. Our policy hopes to recreate these kinds of public interactions and we look forward to other offices within the federal government joining us in working on FOSS projects.</p>

<p>In the next few days, we're excited to publish a contributorâ€™s guide about reuse and sharing of our code and some advice on working in the open from day one.</p>
