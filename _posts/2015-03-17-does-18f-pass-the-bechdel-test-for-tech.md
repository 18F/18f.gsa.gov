Kaitlin Devine, 18F’s Director of Engineering recently noticed this
tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Does your project pass the Bechdel test?

The coding Bechdel test, as described above, is a variant of the
original Bechdel test, which was created by writer and graphic novelist
Alison Bechdel. The Bechdel test was originally designed to evaluate
works of fiction. A work passed if at least one woman had a conversation with another woman about something other than a man.

We decided to see how many 18F projects pass this modified test. To
pass, a project had to have at least one function written by a woman dev
that called another function written by another woman dev.

Kaitlin posed the question to a group of 18F employees, which prompted a
long conversation about our internal values and culture. The
conversation started with us quickly listing the projects that passed
the Bechdel coding test, but then shifted after one of our devs then
raised a good point: She said some of our projects had lots of female
devs, but did not pass the test as defined. 18f.gsa.gov, for example,
uses a framework and language called [*SASS*](http://sass-lang.com/) to generate the
styles used on each page. The overwhelming majority of our custom SASS was written by
a woman, and another woman wrote a significant amount of HTML that
relies on that SASS, but because neither language has “functions” it
fails the test.

The conversation also caused us to think about how we holistically
evaluate our inclusivity as a team. There are also many roles on our
product teams other than developers that are just as important to the
success of a product. Visual designers, content designers, user
experience researchers: all of these roles are critical to shipping a
product. Is there another way of evaluating our teams that takes these
roles into consideration? This test is also limited with respect to
other protected classes. It only addresses gender: race, socio-economic
status, disability, and others are important considerations when
building successful, diverse teams.

Nevertheless, a “Bechdel Test for Code” is valuable because it addresses
that tech as a whole has issues that it needs to surmount. Gender
balance in engineering, therefore, needs to be acknowledged specifically
even if this test isn’t the only way we measure inclusivity at 18F. It
is a conversation we will continue to have at 18F to make sure we are
building a team that looks like America and works like America. As our
projects become Bechdel compliant, we plan to note the change.

The Results:

Act*](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/fedspendingtransparency.github.io) -
Consulting engagement to advise on the federal spending data standards
and corresponding pilot project mandated by the DATA Act. Kaitlin Devine
mentions, “There isn't actually any code associated with this right now,
only static content. We will have some in a few weeks which will pass
the test.”
