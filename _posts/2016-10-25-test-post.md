excerpt: "
Over the past few months, we’ve released several products — including checklists, a handbook, and classes — to help new hires orient themselves to 18F.

By far the most successful onboarding item we’ve released is a Slack bot that sends scheduled messages to new hires so that they don’t experience information overload during their first week."
