Recently, a number of teammates coordinated to put on three DigitalGov University courses that covered a range of topics, from culture change and open source to the latest in API trends. Mike Bland wrote about [his talk, "Large Scale Development Culture Change: Google and the U.S. Government," last Thursday](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/12/11/large-scale-development-culture-change/), but in case you missed it we wanted to highlight the others here.

The [DigitalGov University](https://www.digitalgov.gov/digitalgov-university/) team here at GSA does great work, hosting any number of events on all kinds of topics to help those who are working on the government’s online presence.  Anyone from across the federal government can volunteer to present on what their topics of expertise, sharing knowledge much farther than they would be able to on their own.

Our team is passionate about collaboration with our fellow agencies on topics all across the digital realm.  If you weren’t able to join us, we’ve posted the videos from each event below.  Feel free to [reach out](mailto:18f@gsa.gov) if we can be of any help to your agencies on these topics or whatever else you’re working on.  And keep an eye out for [upcoming DigitalGov University courses](https://www.digitalgov.gov/events/).  We know you're very busy but hope that you find some of these helpful.  :)
