  At 18F, we like to keep in touch with our project partners. 18F partnered with
  the USGS Water Mission Area (WMA) from March 2020 to
  June 2022 on a wide variety of projects together. We caught up with
  Emily Read, Chief for Web Communications Branch at USGS Water Mission Area.

_This is the second in a series of blog posts where 18F checks in with our partners throughout the government. Previously in this series: [18F Checks In With Jerome Lee and the eAPD Project](https://18f.gsa.gov/2022/11/29/18f-checks-in-with-jerome-lee-and-the-eapd-project/)._

18F partnered with USGS on four different projects from March 2020 to June 2022. We worked on a wide variety of projects together, including: Water Mission Area (WMA) Platform Modernization Path Analysis, Experiment & Iterate, and Acquisition Consulting; National Groundwater Monitoring Network (NGWMN) Path Analysis; and National Water Information System (NWIS) Data Strategy. 

_A terminology note: a [Path Analysis](https://18f.gsa.gov/2021/02/02/path-analysis-technical-assessments-toward-more-durable-usable-systems/) is an 18F offering that helps identify the right problems that need to be solved through user research and analysis, and an [Experiment & Iterate](https://18f.gsa.gov/how-we-work/) is a follow-on offering after completing a Path Analysis to work on a solution to the identified problem together. This can focus on building a working product, preparing a procurement package, or training a team to take over development._

We had a conversation with Emily Read, Chief for Web Communications Branch at USGS Water Mission Area, to see how their agency is continuing with the work.

### _What has been going on with this work since 18F rolled off?_

All 18F does is so much with us now. It is a large part of our thinking and work processes. For example, see our ['How We Work' blog](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/how-we-work-spring-2021/) from last year. When we first started working with 18F, I didn’t realize how profound the impact would be on our team. I thought we just needed some knowledge transfer. But we did that in a big way. We now run Path Analyses in-house with our own teams. Although we haven’t recreated the Experiment & Iterate process exactly, we do some elements of it through our agile development approach. We have done multiple path analyses in a row to answer questions about specific systems we need to modernize. The purpose is to reduce the risk of IT investment and learn more about users and technology. You can see just how much we’ve integrated methods we learned from 18F by reading [this blog about the user-centered design methods we employ at USGS Water](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/user-centered-design/).

We typically do 8-week Path Analyses (PAs), and some shorter ones when the topic is of smaller scope or complexity, if there’s an urgent need, or if the resources aren’t available for a full blown PA. We continue to engage stakeholders in the PA process, and learn from users. We took the method that is quite standard at 18F, and adapted the size and need depending on questions and challenges. I didn’t know going into working with 18F how deeply we would integrate the way we work, and now we regularly have team members and stakeholders say, “We need a discovery on this or that.” That shows how beneficial our stakeholders consider PAs to be, because we involve them in the process, trained them up on it, and they are bought in on the value. 

We also partnered to improve another part of our processes, through acquisition consulting. We partnered with 18F on this to decrease the amount of time required to acquire IT services, and to increase the quality and fit of the IT services we acquired. We largely worked according to the [18F Modular Contracting and Agile Development playbook](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development). This new approach was successful. Over a series of a few months, we developed a strategy around the branch workforce, wrote a statement of objectives, and got the request for proposals lined up. We made an award within 4 months of the request for proposals being released. As far as I know, this was a record time to award for our organization. The team we awarded is a highly productive agile team, and they’ve been great to work with so far. This new way of contracting is a nice complement to the way we work. It is more modular and changes what we are doing in federal hiring. It helps with how we staff up with changing budgets and evolving priorities. I can't imagine where we would be right now without working with 18F. Working with 18F has left an imprint on my branch and with my team and has been key to retaining a talented workforce – bringing modern methods to government IT makes USGS a better place to work. Here are a few of our recent releases that use the best available tools and tech including login.gov and the US Web Design System: [Water Alert](https://accounts.waterdata.usgs.gov/wateralert/) and [modernized Monitoring Location pages](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/05428500), but big challenges remain. 

Before we started working with 18F, we had a lot of products — maybe 25 or more different web applications all serving water data. We have decommissioned a lot since then. But, we are now at the point where a lot of products that can be easily decommissioned and are straightforward to modernize are already done — or we have a clear path forward for them. And so we are left with products we know provide some value, but it’s not immediately clear where they fit in or how to move forward. Those are the most challenging parts right now. We went from a team of product owners managing many products, and now the same team is managing fewer and fewer products as we continue to collapse systems down, combine technology, and streamline user journeys. We don’t know how it will work out because it is complex and we haven’t done it before.

### _What makes you most proud about this work?_

I'm proud that we are the first group in our agency to work with 18F, and through the partnership, we broke conventional approaches that haven’t worked well in the past. I am very proud we tried something new that has proven to be very valuable, and how valuable the results have been to our work. Our team has really internalized the learnings in our own process. The partnership lives on through our ongoing work. 

### _What are some recent challenges or interesting problems that you have been working on?_

We have a historically very large web product portfolio that has required a lot of product owners operating mostly independently. We are intentionally narrowing the portfolio down to deliver the same data through fewer endpoints. As we narrow the portfolio, it raises the question of how ongoing product management will need to shift and adapt as our products become more interconnected, interdependent, and less duplicative. Following the findings from user research and tech analysis, we know we also need to make the products we do develop more adaptable to new data types that become available. So instead of developing a new web app for every new data type — which is really confusing for a user — we need to work carefully and thoughtfully to understand how new data can be served through existing endpoints when possible to meet user needs. We don’t have a playbook for this but recognize it as a challenge we need to address. 
We are also starting to think about what it looks like when these products are modernized, i.e. how much does continuous development on a modernized data product cost? What does ongoing product management look like? We have more questions and exploration we need to do here, but have so much more confidence in doing so knowing that we’re not alone in it. Maybe this will be a topic of future partnership!
