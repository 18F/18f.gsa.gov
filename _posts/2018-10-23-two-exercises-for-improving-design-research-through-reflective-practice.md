Maturing your design research practice is a bit like honing your skills
at cooking. Experienced researchers rely on a refined set of
sensibilities, or tastes, in their use and application of research
methods; they create, curate, and refine informational recipes that turn
raw data into palatable insights. And just like cooking, everyone can
improve in their research abilities with a bit of [reflective practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice).

In this article, I’ll describe two exercises that I’ve recently
encouraged at 18F to promote reflective practice around design research.
I’ll address some of the challenges I’ve faced and the benefits I
believe we might realize in encouraging routine reflection.

## Exercise 1: Moderated research critiques

A few months ago, I watched a video of someone moderating a usability
test in a way that I considered to be non-ideal. While my initial
inclination was to give this person direct feedback, I eventually
decided against it for fear that my feedback might not be well received;
this person did not claim expertise as a research moderator, and I did
not want to discourage them. Instead, I started to wonder how I might
normalize an environment in which a researcher might expect to receive
constructive criticism. I decided to run a “moderated research critique”
and submit my own work for review.

### What it is

A moderated research critique is one part asynchronous [master class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_class) and one part
[fishbowl exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkWl9b0FZSE). It’s
performed with two goals in mind: The master class-inspired part
effectively asks the question “how might I moderate research better?”
The fishbowl exercise-inspired part helps build the team’s awareness of
the skills and sensibilities that go into good research moderation.

### How it works

First, record a video of yourself or a teammate moderating a research
session (for example, a user interview or a usability test). In this
case, I chose a video of myself moderating a usability test from the
same study as the aforementioned video I took issue with.

Second, ask another researcher, ideally someone more experienced than
yourself, for feedback on your performance — specifically, time-stamped
feedback. In this case, I sent the video of my session to my 18F
colleague Victor Udoewa. I also shared with him the research plan for
this study and the “interview prompts” I’d used to guide my moderation.
Victor replied with the times where he thought I moderated well and
times I might have done better (for example, when I suggested alternate
UI designs after observing my participant struggle at completing a
task).

It may have been better to ask what she would prefer first."/>

Third, socialize the performance-related feedback you receive. In this
case, I passed my recording and the time-stamped feedback I received
along to other designers in my 18F critique group. 18F designers are
divided into four-person critique groups that usually meet for 30
minutes a week. Discussing my moderated research performance was of
interest to this group because 18F designers view research as a team
sport — each designer will occasionally find ourselves in positions
where we’ll need to moderate research!

Many critique groups critique *artifacts* rather than videos of
researchers moderating interviews (making this more like an asynchronous
fishbowl exercise). Time-stamped feedback is an especially useful
starting point for scanning the video to specific parts and soliciting
additional feedback and discussion.

## Exercise 2: Research review

More recently, I found myself four months into what ultimately turned
out to be a five-month, research-led engagement. This engagement began
with foundational research. Over a two-month period, my colleagues and I
conducted over 25 hours of stakeholder and user interviews. At the end
of this research, we prepared a veritable cornucopia of deliverables: a
[mental models](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/mental-modeling/)
diagram and [personas](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/personas/) as
well as a vision, mission, and a set of values and design principles for
the agency’s flagship product.

In the following months, this engagement transitioned to a “lean UX”
approach of building, measuring, learning. My colleagues and I held
internal bake-offs in which [design studios](https://methods.18f.gov/design-studio/) gave way to [dot voting](https://methods.18f.gov/feature-dot-voting/) sessions and
[prototyping](https://methods.18f.gov/make/prototyping/). Once we’d
built enough to put in front of users, we conducted validative research —
[usability testing](https://methods.18f.gov/validate/usability-testing/) — to
determine whether our ideas were too hot, too cold, or just right.

As I approached the end of this engagement, I began to wonder how I
might encourage the team to reflect on the pros and cons of how we’d
scoped our various studies. With an in-house usability lab and full-time
staff dedicated to research, our agency partners were well versed in
moderating usability tests. I began to wonder *how I might help them
reflect on how — and how often — they might conduct broader research
going forward?* This led me to hold a research review.

### What it is

A research review is a research-focused facilitation exercise that
encourages the team to reflect on its recent studies to inform its
approach to future ones. The goal is better, more collaborative
research.

### How it works

A research review proceeds in two parts. In the first, the product team
reviews the design of and findings from recent studies (a natural
prerequisite here is that you’ll need to have conducted a few studies
beforehand). In the second, the team conducts a retrospective focused
on research practices.

As I mentioned, this was a five-month engagement that began with two
months of foundational research and concluded with three months of
generative and validative research. My hunch was that while this
approach was commonsensical for 18F, it was likely not as intuitive to
our agency partners; if my own progression as a researcher says
anything, people who are new to research are more likely to understand
why and how they might do usability testing than why and how they’d do
foundational or generative research.

For that reason, I framed our review with [a tweet by Dave Malouf](https://twitter.com/daveixd/status/992924500667830273)
describing research across various levels:

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/blog/design-research-reflective-practice/tweet.png" alt="Screenshot of a tweet by Dave Malouf. Text reads: A great framing I use is there are 3 levels of research: Foundational: akin to problem-space rsearch. (Opportunity for design) Generative: product idea generation w/in a space (get to the right design) Validative: is the product I've got good. (is the Design right?)"/>

I also shared this local-maxima diagram I learned about from [Joshua Porter’s 52 Weeks of UX](http://52weeksofux.com/post/694598769/the-local-maximum).

![Animation: local-maxima diagram showing the differences between your design and a better design]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/blog/design-research-reflective-practice/locmax.gif)

I explained that foundational research is useful for breaking out of
“local maximas” and understanding the landscape in which the team is
designing. Generative and validative research, on the other hand, is
useful for making sure we’re moving in the right direction (i.e., up the
mountain).

Next, I reviewed the design of the four studies we’d conducted. I
described the problem statements that framed these studies, the methods
we employed, the insights we gained, and the design decisions we made.

Summarizing our research to date put us in a great position to do a 
practice-related research retrospective. After inviting the team to 
a shared document, I asked everyone to spend two minutes each answering the
following questions:

-   **Liked:** What have you liked about the research we’ve done so far?
-   **Learned:** What have you learned about research?
-   **Lacked:** What are we missing or forgetting?
-   **Long for:** What’s inhibiting your office from doing more research like this after 18F leaves?

To conclude the session, we did a quick dot vote (everyone got 4 dots to
assign per question) to identify the team’s points of agreement. I ended
the session by facilitating a conversation in which the team identified
ways they might improve their research by incorporating more
foundational and generative research.

## Yes, chef

While the primary benefit of these exercises is becoming a better
researcher, their social nature promises additional benefits. Specifically,
routinely performing these exercises can:

1.  Demonstrate humility
2.  Encourage awareness that listening is a foundational part of a designer’s toolkit
3.  Encourage awareness of the subtle decisions that shape research
4.  Move conversations past “should we research” to “how can we research better”
5.  Potentially prevent frustrating experiences for participants (see [this example](https://twitter.com/geoffwilsonUX/status/1036742766326235137))
6.  Help reduce biased study design
7.  Encourage alignment around study design
8.  Reduce the risk of overly optimistic interpretation (nods to Erika Hall)
9.  Potentially make findings more actionable
