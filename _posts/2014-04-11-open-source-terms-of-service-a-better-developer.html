<p>One of the important changes occurring across the federal government is the role of <a href="http://ben.balter.com/2014/01/27/open-collaboration/">open source for non-code projects</a> - using an open, iterative model of collaboration inherited from the coding community for all kinds of new purposes. Want to see a great example of this in action? In recent years, as <a href="https://www.data.gov/developers/apis">more and more agencies offer public APIs</a>, some have included a developer terms of service (TOS).</p>

<p>This document helps to frame expectations, rights, and responsibilities for any developers who want to use a specific API. Rather than re-invent the wheel, agencies are encouraged to look at <a href="https://github.com/18F/API-All-the-X/blob/master/developer_hub_kit.md#terms-of-service">existing examples</a> from their sister agencies and repurpose existing language. But that also means that there may be a need for new thinking about the clauses that make up the relationship agencies set up with outside developers.</p>
<p>Agencies are now taking the next step to collaborate on a model terms of service that reflects the best practices and up-to-date thinking of the developers that are the target audience of government APIs. A <a href="https://github.com/GSA/API-Resources/issues/1">robust discussion is ongoing</a> and a range of options will be available to agencies to use. Some contributors evolved the conversation further, urging the use of an API service accord <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/14/api-service-accord/">in the place of a terms of service</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a developer who uses APIs of any kind - government-produced or not - please <a href="https://github.com/GSA/API-Resources/issues/1">share your thoughts</a> on how agencies can optimize their developer experience and keep improving their APIs. API usability is a core value here at 18F but we need your help, so keep the feedback coming.</p>
