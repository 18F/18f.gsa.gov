When Nepal was hit with a devastating earthquake on April 25, the folks
at [MapGive](http://mapgive.state.gov/) and others in the
OpenStreetMap community sprang into action, organizing volunteer mappers
and coordinating with mapping teams on the ground in Kathmandu.

In the first 48 hours, a team of more than 2,000 volunteers mapped more than
13,000 miles of road and 110,000 buildings.

At a recent [moveForward(100); event](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/05/11/moveforward/), Mikel Maron, a
Presidential Innovation Fellow at the State Department, told the story
of how MapGive worked with other mappers to help responders during the
earthquake. Watch his presentation above.
