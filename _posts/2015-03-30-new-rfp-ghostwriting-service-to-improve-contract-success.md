Often, the seeds of success — or failure — of federal IT projects are
planted in the Request for Proposals (RFPs) themselves. A well-written
RFP, with clearly defined business objectives and technical direction,
will increase the chances of a successful project. A poorly written RFP,
on the other hand, will expose you to such risks as overbidding to
compensate for uncertainty, vendor lock-in, and catastrophic failure due
to miscommunication and misunderstanding. These problems will likely
send you down a long and painful path of technical rework, contract
modifications, and cost and schedule overruns. You don’t want that. The
taxpaying public doesn’t want that. And neither does 18F.

That’s why [18F Consulting](https://18f.gsa.gov/consulting/) is now
offering **RFP Ghostwriting and Review** as a service to federal
agencies.

Through this new service, 18F is leveraging the experience of more than
70 designers, developers, and product specialists to assist with your
next RFP. These individuals are recognized experts in modern digital
best practices, including user-centered design, agile development,
application programming interfaces (APIs), and open source technologies.
With these types of technical brains at your service, we can help you
craft an RFP that increases your acquisition project’s probability of
success.

These are the types of questions we ask as we’re reviewing RFPs:

1.  Based on the need you’re trying to address, are you making
    appropriate uses of the various software development methods
    (e.g., agile, waterfall)?
2.  How can you most effectively include considerations for user-centered
    design and development?
3.  Where are there opportunities to incorporate proven, commodity IT
    solutions (e.g., Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) over expensive
    custom-built solutions)?
4.  Are you making appropriate use of [open
    source](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/11/26/how-to-use-more-open-source/)
    to get access to large communities supporting reliable,
    inexpensive software?
5.  What explicit, results-oriented success criteria will you use to
    evaluate the success of the project?
6.  Have you provided potential bidders sufficient clarity to remove
    uncertainty and lower the expected bid price, without
    over-specifying how the work will be done?
7.  Have you modularized the architecture of your system? Do you have
    modularized contracting to support it?
8.  Are you maximizing the benefits of each of the plays from the USDS
    [Digital Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov)?
