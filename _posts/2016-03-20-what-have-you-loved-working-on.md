Two weeks ago, we asked everyone across 18F to answer a few simple questions: [Why did you join 18F?]() [What was your path to get here?]() And what have you loved working on?

Dozens of people from every team and time zone responded, and today we share their answers to the question: What have you loved working on?

Here’s the tl;dr: More than one person mentioned that they really enjoyed working on meaningful, mission-driven projects that impact millions of people. It’s true: we work on projects like [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/), a clearinghouse to provide the clearest, most accessible, and reliable national data on college cost, graduation, debt, and post-college earnings, and [an account system](http://myaccount.uscis.dhs.gov/) used by hundreds of thousands of immigrants to keep their information up to date.

When we work on big, meaningful projects, we do it in the open — all of [our code is public](https://github.com/18F/) and we publish how-tos, tutorials, and what we’ve learned on the 18F blog.

If this post and these projects appeal to you, you can see our open positions and apply to 18F [on our join page](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/index.html).

### Strategy

_Our strategists help agencies transform into modern, high-functioning organizations through new management models, culture change, modern practices, empowered talent, data access, and collaboration tools._

“I have been working at Census with government workers who are incredibly talented experts, in tech and statistics. Finding ways to support their good work, and move the bureau towards internet data collection for 2020 has been incredibly rewarding. I also work with an incredible group of 18F people in this endeavor, and it is an honor to be side-by-side with so many talented strategists.”  - {{ "kane" | team_link}}

“Love bureaucracy hacking. Love being entrepreneurial in a large, complex environment that can seem impervious. (Oh yes! It's happening.) Loved when a senior Department of Defense official commended me for putting “Philip sized holes in the walls” across the Pentagon.” (Ed. note: Not literally.) - **Philip Harding**

“I continue to pinch myself about the type of work I get to do at 18F. Not only are the impact areas incredibly compelling (helping the Navy place the right officers in the right jobs at the right time; making it easier for EPA to monitor air emissions and pesticides ingredients to keep our environment safe), but the fact that I get to wear all three of my design research, UX design, and product strategy hats interchangeably is just crazy-awesome. I am totally in the zone when helping our agency partners move themselves out of "analysis paralysis" and into experimenting with small prototypes designed to meet the needs of real humans, and the fact that I get to do that every day at 18F makes me ridiculously, geekily happy.” - **Alex Pandel**

“So far I have helped plan and execute on projects as wide-ranging as helping our armed forces better coordinate their global talent pool; aiding the Department of the Treasury in bringing a new level of financial transparency to the public; and assisting the Environmental Protection Agency in thinking through ways to modernize their approach to labeling and inspecting pesticides. Each project has been different, but in every case I’ve been able to see how my efforts are going to positively impact the way our country functions, and I’m extremely grateful of the opportunity to get to do this work.” - {{ "lane-becker" | team_link }}

“I love facilitating workshops and helping people articulate what it is their are trying to do. No matter the agency (or institution), people get stuck articulating the problem the want to solve — which makes it harder to find a solution. Whether drafting contracts, developing a prototype, or scoping the next phase of a project, people light up when they feel heard and see a path forward. It doesn't get old.” - {{ "jessie-posilkin" | team_link}}

“I have loved working on [Playbook in Action](https://playbook-in-action.apps.cloud.gov/#/?_k=2quwrb), a web application that hopes to make it easier for government to adopt the principles of the [USDS Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) in contracted digital services.” - {{ "julia-winn" | team_link}}

“Currently working on two agencies digital transformation projects. It's amazing to see how we have been able to help shape two very large agencies to focus on things like human-centered design and improved IT practices.” - {{ "romke" | team_link}}

“The first two months have been incredible. Still very early on at my tenure at 18F; but our commitment to user centric design and open source...just. makes. so. much. sense.” - {{ "porta-antiporta" | team_link}}

“I have loved working on teams with diverse people and experiences, where we can use a tangible technology goal to showcase how modern practices (tools, tech, and management) can make the services we delivery more efficient and effective — and ultimately transform the capabilities of government provides.”  - {{ "jayhuie" | team_link}}

“It's been great working with wonderfully talented people from all over the country who have the same passion for improving our government. Even though I've only been here for four months, I've already been able to help agencies practice Agile practices, and now I've working to move them to ‘the cloud’.”  - {{ "mike-hsu" | team_link}}

“While at 18F, I’ve enjoyed coaching partners on how agile works and why user-centered design is important. I’m currently working on a prototyping project, which in itself is a new experience for our partners that I think they will learn a lot from.”  - {{ "larry-bafundo" | team_link}}

"I’ve enjoyed joining the team working at the National Technical Information Service, where we’re applying modern lean techniques such as the Business Model Canvas to their portfolio of data products and services. It’s a great feeling to help an agency redefine existing products, and launch new ones in a public sector context."  - {{ "timothy-jones" | team_link}}

“I have loved working with the caring and smart executives, program officers, contracting officers, certifiers, writers, subject matter experts, and administrative assistants who are charged with making government work. The Department of Labor, Social Security, Treasury, Environmental Protection Agency — all the agencies I have worked with have people like this. A good day is when I listen to their problem, offer an idea or process improvement that helps them achieve their goal — and they adopt it and love it!”  - {{ "jtag" | team_link}}

“I've loved working on new acquisition processes focused on smaller, incremental contracts that can show our clients that this new agile, modular methodology will work. I've enjoyed being part of something where experimentation and risk-taking is encouraged and there's less fear of failing. I've enjoyed being part of a team that acknowledges the current approach to acquiring tech is broken, and is ready to try new ways of doing it differently.”  - {{ "randy-hart" | team_link}}
