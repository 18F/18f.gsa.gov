Often times, the seeds of success — or failure — of Federal IT
projects are planted in the Request for Proposals (RFPs) themselves. A
well-written RFP, with clearly defined business objectives and technical
direction, will increase the chances of a successful project. A poorly
written RFP, on the other hand, will expose you to such risks as
overbidding to compensate for uncertainty, vendor lock-in, and
catastrophic failure due to miscommunication and misunderstanding. These
problems will likely send you down a long and painful path of technical
rework, contract modifications, and cost and schedule overruns. You
don’t want that. The taxpaying public doesn’t want that. And neither
does 18F.

That’s why _[18F Consulting](http://18f.github.io/consulting/)_ is now
offering __RFP Ghostwriting and Review__ as a service to Federal
agencies.

Through this new service, 18F is leveraging over 50 designers,
developers, and product specialists to assist with your next RFP. These
individuals are recognized experts in modern digital best practices,
including user-centered design, agile development, application
programming interfaces (APIs), and open source technologies. With these
types of technical brains at your service, we can help you craft an RFP
that increases your acquisition project’s probability of success.

![RFP + Tech =  Increased probability of success](/assets/blog/rfpaas/image00.png)

The types of questions that we ask when reviewing RFPs include:

1. Based on the need you’re trying to address, are you making appropriate uses of the various software development methods (e.g., agile, waterfall)?
2. Where are there opportunities to incorporate proven, commodity IT solutions (e.g., Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) over expensive custom-built solutions)?
3. Are you making appropriate use of _[open source](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/11/26/how-to-use-more-open-source/)_ to get access to large communities supporting reliable, inexpensive software?
4. What explicit, results-oriented success criteria will you use to evaluate the success of the project?
5. Have you provided potential bidders sufficient clarity to remove uncertainty and lower the expected bid price, without over-specifying how the work will be done?
6. Have you modularized the architecture of your system, and do you have modularized contracting to support it?
7. Are you maximizing the benefits of each of the plays from the USDS _[Digital Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov)_?

So what’s the best way for you to engage 18F Consulting for RFP
Ghostwriting? We offer this service on a cost-reimbursable basis under
the authority of the _[Economy
Act](http://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%2017_5.html)_. A simple
Interagency Agreement (IAA) is all that’s required to retain our
service.

Given the small dollar nature of the RFP Ghostwriting and Review
service, we prefer to structure the IAA similarly to an IDIQ/BPA. That
is, an umbrella agreement establishing the scope of service, service
levels, and terms & conditions against which multiple individual orders
can be made. This structure helps to limit the amount of administrative
paperwork to transact business.

Ready to get started? So are we. Please, _[get in
touch](mailto:18f@gsa.gov)_ to discuss next steps.
