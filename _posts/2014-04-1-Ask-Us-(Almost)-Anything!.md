[GitHub for Government](https://github.com/government) did their very first [AMA (Ask Me Anything)](https://github.com/government/ask-me-anything) last week with [Philadelphia’s Chief Data Officer, Mark Headd](https://github.com/government/ask-me-anything/issues/1). After some prodding by Github’s Head Bureaucat, [Ben Balter](https://github.com/benbalter), 18F decided to use this new avenue to do some Q&A.

If you have questions about [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) or the [Presidential Innovation Fellows](http://wh.gov/innovationfellows) program, please come [Ask Us (almost) Anything](https://github.com/government/ask-me-anything/issues/4)!
