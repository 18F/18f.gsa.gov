At the end of last year, we asked everyone at 18F to [*reflect on a
meaningful
project*](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/12/23/looking-back-2015-our-own-words/)
they worked on in 2015. We received dozens of responses, ranging from
[*working on internal
tools*](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/12/23/looking-back-2015-our-own-words/#guides,-resources,-and-tools)
to almost [*doubling our
workforce*](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/12/23/looking-back-2015-our-own-words/#growing-our-team).

To celebrate our second anniversary, we once again reached out to people
across 18F. This time, we were curious about:

-   What led them to 18F

-   What their pathway into the federal government looked like

-   What they’ve loved working on so far

We got more than 100 responses, including people from every team and
time zone, and we’re excited to share their responses over the next few
days. Today’s post answers the question: **Why did you join 18F?**

Want to see your name on this list? You can see open positions and how
to apply [*on our join
page*](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/index.html).

Why did you join 18F?
---------------------

### Design
*18F Design provide content, visual, and interactive design to the rest
of the organization.*

“I wanted a new challenge, and I wanted to learn from some of the best
minds in design and technology.” - [**Shawn
Allen**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/shawn/)

“18F started up during my Code for America fellowship, so I had a chance
to observe what 18F was doing while I was completing my fellowship. It
was a natural progression from using technology to solve local issues to
national issues. I knew that the variety of projects, impact, and people
working here was unparalleled. I could tell the people who worked at 18F
were extremely talented, had a depth of experience, and hearts the size
of Jupiter (as Todd Park likes to say). Designing for the public good
was the only thing that felt worthwhile to me.” - [**Maya
Benari**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/maya/)

“I joined 18F to make a big impact on how our government works and
serves its people. I love getting to combine design, technology, and
public service by working on real, impactful products and services for
the public. I’ve worked on many different things at 18F, and I’m
constantly amazed both by my colleagues and how much I am always
learning and growing here.

I came to 18F after getting a masters in information management and
human-computer interaction, and time at the Sunlight Foundation and
NPR.” - [**Nick Brethauer**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/brethauer/)

“The answer to why I joined is not actually all that interesting — it's
the same reason I've taken almost every job I've had: it seemed like 18F
is a bunch of good people focused on problems worth solving.

​The more interesting question is why — as I approach my two year mark,
the average lifespan of most jobs that my demographic and I take — I'm
not tempted to leave.

This is hard work. It is taxing both mentally and emotionally. The
problems we are working on are indeed worth solving, and are also
momentous, entrenched, and many will outlast our best attempts to solve
them. We will at times be completely overwhelmed by the size and
complexity of tasks that at first blush seemed simple.

To me, more interesting than why I came is why I am staying. And I'm
staying for essentially one reason: I stay because I feel that I have
stumbled on an exceedingly rare thing, a thing that I have experienced
precious few times in my life. I have found in 18F a band of colleagues
that not only have the ambition to focus on ridiculously hard problems
and the gumption to think they can make progress, that recognizes that
this work, while serious, needs creativity and creativity eschews prim
and proper seriousness. I'm staying because I have found in 18F a
nurturing community that celebrates each other's successes, that helps
each other up and dusts each other off after our inevitable missteps,
that all the while believes not only in the fundamental rightness of our
mission, but in each other.

I'm staying because I have found my people.” **-** [**Jeremy

“I was inspired by the passionate, skilled cohort I saw working on
projects with huge potential for impact. In my experience, interacting
with government services often leaves people feeling frustrated and
disempowered. I wanted to design services that effectively meet the
needs of their users, while helping to build a design culture in
government.” - [**Erica Deahl**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/erica/)

{{ "john-demoyer" | team_photo }}

**“**Having the chance to work on distributed teams was one of the main
reasons I joined 18F. I love knowing that the people building products
for the American public are spread out all over the country. Re-thinking
the way I collaborate on designs to accommodate a team that spans 3
time-zones has been one of the most exciting parts of my job.” -
[**John Donmoyer**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/john-donmoyer/)

“I wanted to work for a civic organization that understands the value of
editorial strategy, working in the open, and working remotely.” -
[**Nicole Fenton**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/nicole-fenton/)

{{ "egoodman" | team_photo }}

“I joined 18F because I like solving complicated design questions, and
the federal government offers some of the most complicated questions out
there.” - [**Elizabeth Goodman**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/egoodman/)

{{ "mhz" | team_photo }}

“I joined 18F because I want to make government services things people
delight in using. There is no reason that interacting with the
government needs to be stressful and difficult.” - [**Michelle
Hertzfeld**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/mhz/)

{{ "jhunter" | team_photo }}

“I was drawn to its commitment to improving opportunities for the
general public by transforming government — increasing its efficiency,
transparency, and accountability.” - [**Jeannine
Hunter**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/jhunter/)

{{ "ryan-sibley" | team_photo}}

“I chose to work at 18F because I see it as an opportunity to improve
how government works from the inside. I spent a lot of years translating
government documents and data so regular people can get the information
they need to improve their lives and inform themselves. But now there is
a demonstrated willingness by the government to be better at
communicating efficiently and to provide more reliable and tested tools.
I saw that willingness as an opportunity for me to contribute all I’ve
learned in my career so far and to make a difference.” - [**Ryan
Sibley**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/ryan-sibley/)

{{ "gail" | team_photo }}

“I joined 18F because I felt that my UX skills could make life easier
for those who are in the most need. Working in the private sector didn’t
satisfy my need for meaningful work. Put more succinctly, I was looking
for work that I’d be willing to do for free. The work at 18F has
enriched my life more than I could imagine.” - [**Gail
Swanson**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/gail/)

{{ "jthibault" | team_photo }}

“Because this is a really exciting time for technology and digital
services in government, I wanted to work on products that improve the
public’s experience with government, and I wanted to become a more
engaged citizen.” - [**Jennifer
Thibault**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/jthibault/)

{{ "christopher-goranson" | team_photo }}


“It was a fantastic opportunity to continue work started through the
Presidential Innovation Fellows program. Improving government products
and services for the American people with a group of incredibly talented
individuals and strong government partners provided a great opportunity
for meaningful work.” - [**Chris
Goranson**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/christopher-goranson/)

### Acquisitions

*The acquisitions team provides innovative services and solutions to
support digital service delivery. Their teams have a mix of former
contracting officers, developers, and product manager who manage access
to the Agile Delivery Services Marketplace, RFP ghostwriting consulting,
and the micro-purchase platform.*

“As a former state elected official, I lost a lot of sleep worrying
about IT projects. I joined 18F to help reimagine the way state and
local governments design and procure technology so the public gets
better results, taxpayers save millions, and all those public servants
lose less sleep.” - [**Robin
Carnahan**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/robin-carnahan/)

{{ "alan" | team_photo }}

“I joined 18F to work towards a great mission and to be at a place that
allowed me to grow and develop professionally. I was finishing my last
year of part-time law school when I joined 18F. I always felt very
fortunate that I could start a job somewhere that was flexible about
night school. During my time here, I’ve seen countless colleagues
receive encouragement and support to develop their skill set outside of
18F. Coming into 18F, I had spent a lot of time interning in different
parts of government, and I was never satisfied with the way they handled
technology. Being at a place like 18F, where helping government improve
its use of technology is our mandate, is a dream job.” **-** [**Alan
deLevie**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/alan/)

“To work on how technology could improve government service delivery in
a deeper way than just as a communications platform.” - **Laura
Gerhardt**

{{ "alla" | team_photo }}

“I’ve always been passionate about public service and have spent time
working on tech issues in various federal agencies. I distinctly
remember the 18F announcement blog post and hoping there would one day
be room for someone like me (a lawyer/product manager) to join the
spectacular team GSA was building.” - [**Alla Goldman
Seiffert**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/alla/)

“Margaret Mead said it best "Never doubt that a small group of
thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the
only thing that ever has."” - [**Mark
Hopson**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/mark-hopson/)

{{ "jessie-posilkin" | team_photo }}

“To work with smart and kind people who work well on teams.” -

“From the outside, it seemed like what I thought an ideal government
should be. Like most federal agencies, it's focused on serving the
public and has a genuine desire to Do Good, but unlike a lot of
government, it is willing to struggle against the old way in order to Do
*Better.*” - **Greg Walker**

{{ "vdavez" | team_photo }}

“To play a small part in ensuring that America is as hopeful for our
future as we were when we made one giant leap for mankind. (I wrote [*a
blog post*](https://esq.io/blog/posts/joining-18f/) that says more.)” -[

### **Operations**

*Team Ops handles all activities related to travel, non-travel
purchases, legal matters, and equipment requests.*

{{ "joshbailes" | team_photo }}

“18F offered me a chance risk something big for something good. The big
risk was giving up my career path position elsewhere in government to
work for an inside-the-government start up. The good was the goal of
making government more accessible to individuals.” - [**Josh
Bailes**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/joshbailes/)

{{ "ethan" | team_photo }}

“I joined 18F because I saw it as a way to take my existing experience
in operations to the next level. I came here from the Peace Corps, where
I was a computer literacy teacher at a high school in Burkina Faso, and
managed a lot of the day-to-day operations of the program on the side.
Since starting nine months ago (already!), what I appreciate most about
18F is how much I've been able to learn from every division in the
organization. I love having the opportunity to help rethink a variety of
processes from travel to purchasing to staffing on a daily basis.” -
[**Ethan Heppner**](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/ethan/)

“It sounded like a great opportunity to work alongside really talented
people and learn completely new skills” - [**Matthew
