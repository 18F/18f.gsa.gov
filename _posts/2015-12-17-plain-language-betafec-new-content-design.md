Campaign finance is complicated.

Whether you’re an individual donor or a Senate candidate, the rules that
apply to raising and spending money in federal elections are as
intricate as they are important.

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has been working since the 1970s
to clarify these rules, and today we’re thrilled to announce the first
major content launch of betaFEC: a guide to registration and reporting
that makes intricate information easier to understand.

Our [betaFEC project](http://beta.fec.gov) is a planned
redesign of the FEC’s web presence, and we’ve been launching new
features in phases. In July, we released the FEC’s [first API](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/07/08/openfec-api/). In October, [we
announced](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/29/welcome-to-betafec/) the beta
release of a new data site.

Today’s launch: Registration and reporting content
--------------------------------------------------

By law, federal candidates must register with the FEC and make regular
campaign finance reports— reports about how they raised and spent funds.
The FEC then releases this information to the public, which helps them
make informed voting decisions.

Today’s release centers around that registration and reporting process;
candidates and people interested in learning about them can use the new
section to better understand the *who*, *what*, *when*, *how*, and *why*
of candidate reporting.

The FEC has already released an immense amount of guidance on this
topic. With the help of dedicated subject matter experts, we looked at
the existing content and condensed it for today’s release. We started
with about 16,000 words. What launched today is fewer than 4,000.

Site visitors can read about registration and reporting as well as view
the different types of registrants — including candidates, political
action committees (PACs), and corporations — all from a single landing
page.

This launch also includes a checklist of essential information for
candidates and their authorized committees. The step-by-step guide
explains how to register a candidacy, how to file regular financial
reports, and more.

Eventually, we’ll launch an essentials checklist for every type of FEC
registrant.

Plain language was an important goal for this project. It lowers the bar
of entry for readers — we don’t want folks to **need** a lawyer just to
clarify the most basic campaign finance information. We also wanted the
site to be a resource for journalists and researchers looking for
background information.

Because of the intricacy of campaign finance law, we had to keep some
technical language in our content. For example, an *individual* isn’t
the same thing as a *person.* And a *contribution* is different than a
*donation.*

Even so, we didn’t want our readers to get lost navigating the site. A
glossary tool allows readers to click an icon next to legal terms and
read the definition.

What folks are saying
---------------------

We’re happy to report that usability testers have had an overwhelmingly
positive reaction to the new content:

-   “This is extremely helpful!”
-   “I know just from this landing page exactly where I want to be. I like how it's a little synopsis.”
-   “I think people are going to find [the glossary] enormously helpful.”

We’re not done yet

This is just the first iteration of the first piece of content — we’d
love your feedback and suggestions for improvement. [File an
