<p><a href="https://github.com/government">GitHub for Government</a> did their very first <a href="https://github.com/government/ask-me-anything">AMA (Ask Me Anything)</a> last week with <a href="https://github.com/government/ask-me-anything/issues/1">Philadelphia&#8217;s Chief Data Officer, Mark Headd</a>. After some prodding by Github&#8217;s Head Bureaucat, <a href="https://github.com/benbalter">Ben Balter</a>, 18F decided to use this new avenue to do some Q&amp;A.</p>
