description: "Why did people make the decision to join 18F? We asked people on every team to reflect on why they came here."
---
At the end of last year, we asked everyone at 18F to [reflect on a
meaningful
project](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/12/23/looking-back-2015-our-own-words/)
they worked on in 2015. We received dozens of responses, ranging from
[working on internal
tools](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/12/23/looking-back-2015-our-own-words/#guides,-resources,-and-tools)
to almost [doubling our
workforce](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/12/23/looking-back-2015-our-own-words/#growing-our-team).

To celebrate our second anniversary, we once again reached out to people
across 18F. This time, we were curious about:

-   What led them to 18F
-   What their pathway into the federal government looked like
-   What they’ve loved working on so far

We got more than 100 responses, including people from every team and
time zone, and we’re excited to share their responses over the next few
days. Today’s post answers the question: **Why did you join 18F?**

Want to see your name on this list? You can see open positions and how
to apply [on our join
page](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/index.html).

Why did you join 18F?
---------------------

### Design
*18F Design provide content, visual, and interactive design to the rest
of the organization.*

“I wanted a new challenge, and I wanted to learn from some of the best
minds in design and technology.” - {{ "shawn" | team_link }}

“18F started up during my Code for America fellowship, so I had a chance
to observe what 18F was doing while I was completing my fellowship. It
was a natural progression from using technology to solve local issues to
national issues. I knew that the variety of projects, impact, and people
working here was unparalleled. I could tell the people who worked at 18F
were extremely talented, had a depth of experience, and hearts the size
of Jupiter (as Todd Park likes to say). Designing for the public good
was the only thing that felt worthwhile to me.” - {{ "maya" | team_link}}</div>

<div class="response-block">
{{ "brethauer" | team_photo }}

“I joined 18F to make a big impact on how our government works and
serves its people. I love getting to combine design, technology, and
public service by working on real, impactful products and services for
the public. I’ve worked on many different things at 18F, and I’m
constantly amazed both by my colleagues and how much I am always
learning and growing here.

I came to 18F after getting a masters in information management and
human-computer interaction, and time at the Sunlight Foundation and
NPR.” - {{ "brethauer" | team_link }}</div>

“The answer to why I joined is not actually all that interesting — it's
the same reason I've taken almost every job I've had: it seemed like 18F
is a bunch of good people focused on problems worth solving.

​The more interesting question is why — as I approach my two year mark,
the average lifespan of most jobs that my demographic and I take — I'm
not tempted to leave.

This is hard work. It is taxing both mentally and emotionally. The
problems we are working on are indeed worth solving, and are also
momentous, entrenched, and many will outlast our best attempts to solve
them. We will at times be completely overwhelmed by the size and
complexity of tasks that at first blush seemed simple.

To me, more interesting than why I came is why I am staying. And I'm
staying for essentially one reason: I stay because I feel that I have
stumbled on an exceedingly rare thing, a thing that I have experienced
precious few times in my life. I have found in 18F a band of colleagues
that not only have the ambition to focus on ridiculously hard problems
and the gumption to think they can make progress, that recognizes that
this work, while serious, needs creativity and creativity eschews prim
and proper seriousness. I'm staying because I have found in 18F a
nurturing community that celebrates each other's successes, that helps
each other up and dusts each other off after our inevitable missteps,
that all the while believes not only in the fundamental rightness of our
mission, but in each other.

I'm staying because I have found my people.” - {{ "jeremy" | team_link}}</div>

“I was inspired by the passionate, skilled cohort I saw working on
projects with huge potential for impact. In my experience, interacting
with government services often leaves people feeling frustrated and
disempowered. I wanted to design services that effectively meet the
needs of their users, while helping to build a design culture in
government.” - {{ "erica" | team_link }}</div>

<blockquote>“Having the chance to work on distributed teams was one of the main
reasons I joined 18F. I love knowing that the people building products
for the American public are spread out all over the country. Re-thinking
the way I collaborate on designs to accommodate a team that spans 3
time-zones has been one of the most exciting parts of my job.” -

the federal government offers some of the most complicated questions out
there.” - {{ "egoodman" | team_link }}</div>

delight in using. There is no reason that interacting with the
government needs to be stressful and difficult.” - {{ "mhz" | team_link }}</div>

“I was drawn to its commitment to improving opportunities for the
general public by transforming government — increasing its efficiency,
transparency, and accountability.” - {{ "jhunter" | team_link }}
</div>
<blockquote>“I chose to work at 18F because I see it as an opportunity to improve
how government works from the inside. I spent a lot of years translating
government documents and data so regular people can get the information
they need to improve their lives and inform themselves. But now there is
a demonstrated willingness by the government to be better at
communicating efficiently and to provide more reliable and tested tools.
I saw that willingness as an opportunity for me to contribute all I’ve
learned in my career so far and to make a difference.” - {{ "ryan-sibley" | team_link }}</blockquote>

<div class="response-block">
{{ "gail" | team_photo }}

“I joined 18F because I felt that my UX skills could make life easier
for those who are in the most need. Working in the private sector didn’t
satisfy my need for meaningful work. Put more succinctly, I was looking
for work that I’d be willing to do for free. The work at 18F has
enriched my life more than I could imagine.” - {{ "gail" | team_link }}</div>

<div class="response-block">
{{ "jthibault" | team_photo }}

“Because this is a really exciting time for technology and digital
services in government, I wanted to work on products that improve the
public’s experience with government, and I wanted to become a more
engaged citizen.” - {{ "jthibault" | team_link }}</div>

### Acquisitions

*The acquisitions team provides innovative services and solutions to
support digital service delivery. Their teams have a mix of former
contracting officers, developers, and product manager who manage access
to the Agile Delivery Services Marketplace, RFP ghostwriting consulting,
and the micro-purchase platform.*

“As a former state elected official, I lost a lot of sleep worrying
about IT projects. I joined 18F to help reimagine the way state and
local governments design and procure technology so the public gets
better results, taxpayers save millions, and all those public servants
lose less sleep.” - {{ "robin-carnahan" | team_link }}</div>

<blockquote>“I joined 18F to work towards a great mission and to be at a place that
allowed me to grow and develop professionally. I was finishing my last
year of part-time law school when I joined 18F. I always felt very
fortunate that I could start a job somewhere that was flexible about
night school. During my time here, I’ve seen countless colleagues
receive encouragement and support to develop their skill set outside of
18F. Coming into 18F, I had spent a lot of time interning in different
parts of government, and I was never satisfied with the way they handled
technology. Being at a place like 18F, where helping government improve
its use of technology is our mandate, is a dream job.” {{ "alan" | team_link }}</blockquote>

<blockquote>“To work on how technology could improve government service delivery in a deeper way than just as a communications platform.” - {{ "laura-gerhardt" | team_link }}</blockquote>

<div class="response-block">
{{ "alla" | team_photo }}

“I’ve always been passionate about public service and have spent time
working on tech issues in various federal agencies. I distinctly
remember the 18F announcement blog post and hoping there would one day
be room for someone like me (a lawyer/product manager) to join the
spectacular team GSA was building.” - {{ "alla" | team_link }}</div>

<blockquote>“From the outside, it seemed like what I thought an ideal government
should be. Like most federal agencies, it's focused on serving the
public and has a genuine desire to Do Good, but unlike a lot of
government, it is willing to struggle against the old way in order to Do
<strong>Better.</strong>” - {{ "michael-walker" | team_link }}</blockquote>

### Operations

purchases, legal matters, and equipment requests.*

<div class="response-block">
{{ "joshbailes" | team_photo }}

“18F offered me a chance to risk something big for something good. The big
risk was giving up my career path position elsewhere in government to
work for an inside-the-government start up. The good was the goal of
making government more accessible to individuals.” - {{ "joshbailes" | team_link }}</div>

<blockquote>“I joined 18F because I saw it as a way to take my existing experience
in operations to the next level. I came here from the Peace Corps, where
I was a computer literacy teacher at a high school in Burkina Faso, and
managed a lot of the day-to-day operations of the program on the side.
Since starting nine months ago (already!), what I appreciate most about
18F is how much I've been able to learn from every division in the
organization. I love having the opportunity to help rethink a variety of
processes from travel to purchasing to staffing on a daily basis.” - {{ "ethan" | team_link }}</blockquote>

<div class="response-block">

“It sounded like a great opportunity to work alongside really talented
people and learn completely new skills” - {{ "matt" | team_link }}</div>


### Outreach

*The Outreach team is responsible for promoting the work of digital
innovators at 18F and across government. Our work spans a number of
media outlets, including [the content of 18F’s public-facing
website](https://18f.gsa.gov/), [our
blog](https://18f.gsa.gov/blog/), our external and internal
newsletters, our Twitter feed ([@18F](https://twitter.com/18F)),
responses to press, and responses to emails to 18f@gsa.gov.*

government watchdog, I wanted the opportunity to switch sides and start
working on some of the problems I’d been identifying.” - {{ "andre" | team_link }}</div>

<div class="response-block">
{{ "melody" | team_photo }}

“The idea of creating and improving products and tools that could
potentially touch millions of people was really appealing, but I
actually decided to join because of the people. They were smart, funny,
warm, and dedicated to the type of public service that I value — and I
wanted to share and learn from and with them. (It’s been great.)” -
{{ "melody" | team_link }}</div>

### Product

*Each project at 18F has a product lead whose job is to ensure the
project is moving forward. A product lead looks at the whole picture and
figures out how to make it work, including making sure we’re
user-centered and agile, taking care of billing and logistics, and
handling other details so that the rest of the team can do its job. We
tend to be generalists, often with skills in code or other disciplines
as well as product. More information about our Product team is available
in the [18F Product
Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/product-guide/index.html)*

<div class="response-block">
{{ "sarah" | team_photo }}

“Our government is on track to become more and more expensive, while the
services we deliver to our people become increasingly unusable and
unavailable. We’ve seen what happens in the world when governments stop
working. If this trend continues, then I think in 5-10 years, my kid
won’t have a country to grow up in. 18F is one part of the movement to
change that reality.

Over the past 15 years, technology has advanced: virtualization has made
it cheaper to run web applications, and made it easier to design and
develop in iterative cycles that respond to what we learn through the
process. Our software has become more interdependent as the majority of
our people use online services and mobile devices. This creates a
challenge of complexity while also providing opportunity to streamline
services. The majority of people could help themselves through direct
online access to services, 24/7 through their mobile devices and the
staff in government offices could focus their efforts on those who
actually need additional assistance. We can create dramatically better
services at significantly lower lost … with the gap able to be closed by
people with skills like mine. It was sacrifice, and at the time appeared
to be a career-limiting move, but sometimes you just gotta do the right
thing.” - {{ "sarah" | team_link}}</div>

“I joined 18F because I believe that there’s tremendous opportunity to
bring people and government together through technology. A lot of what
we’ve learned in the private sector about product development, service
design, and what makes for a great digital experience can be applied at
the federal level and affect millions of Americans for the better.” -

community for awhile, so I had been talking to Presidential Innovation

even when I didn’t know 18F was it.” - {{ "leah" | team_link }}</div>

### Strategy

*We help agencies transform into modern, high-functioning organizations
through new management models, culture change, modern practices,
empowered talent, data access, technology, and collaboration tools. We
transform how agencies understand and execute projects: what to build,
how to build, and who will build it.*

<div class="response-block">
{{ "alan-atlas" | team_photo }}

“I came to 18F for two reasons. Neither reason was something
specifically in my head but once a colleague introduced me to the idea
of 18F and I learned about the organization and its mission and work, it
quickly became compelling for me. The first part of my 'why' was that it
was a chance to help the government build software better in order to
deliver services to the country better. It's no secret to anybody in
high tech that the government has needed some help in this area for a
while, but it's still almost a secret that there is now a way to come
and help. And I wanted to come and help. The second reason, for me, was
professional. As a professional Agile coach, trainer, and consultant,
the U.S. Government represents probably the most challenging
customer/client possible. In government, even when there is a desire to
change, actually doing so is still a difficult challenge. So I came to
the toughest place on earth for plying my trade. And that, ladies and
gentlemen, is my 'why'.” - {{ "alan-atlas" | team_link }}</div>

“I really wanted to give what I could do to my country. My expertise is
in recovering brownfield software projects and the cost of that for
government and the American people is incredibly high.” - {{ "kane" | team_link }}</div>

<blockquote>“I joined 18F because I genuinely believe that thoughtful, well-planned,
well-coordinated use of technology can have a significant positive
impact on the function of our government and its ability to serve the
public. Personally, I am deeply invested in projects where technology
can be used to support social service policy designed to meaningfully
improve the lives of Americans living in underserved and underprivileged
communities.” - {{ "lane-becker" | team_link }}</blockquote>

been doing to improve government services for citizens. I was blown away
by the work they had done and how effective they’d been. I thought, if
we ever start something like that here in the U.S., I want to be a part
of it.” - {{ "angela-colter" | team_link }}</div>

<blockquote>“I joined 18F because of the unique ability to help culturally and
technologically transform the government, guided by principles of
transparency and collaboration. I love the fact that all code I write
can be open source, all frameworks and papers I write can be used by the
public, and that I have the ability to work across the government in
many fascinating agencies and organizations. I feel like I can make a
real impact here.” - {{ "adrian-webb" | team_link }}</blockquote>

is a special time to be serving as our government core operations and

“I feel selfish when I think about why I wanted to join 18F. I wanted to
work on things that have deep meaning and deliver real impact to people

are leaders in their field, within an organization intentionally
nurturing a thoughtful, inclusive, and gratifying culture.” - {{ "ed-mullen" | team_link }}</div>

<blockquote>“You would be justified in calling me a social impact junkie. I've been
working in the civic technology space for several years, and feel like
I've found my professional happy place in using the powers of
human-centered design to help government better serve the American
people in the digital age. However, my career before 18F was always
focused on the local level, so the prospect of putting my skills and
experience to work at the federal level was really exciting, since the
amount of potential impact that our work can have on people's lives
becomes just mind-boggling at that national scale. Plus, having worked
at very small organizations for most of my career, I was really drawn to
the giant well of talent here at 18F, and it's been incredible to work
with such a huge variety of ridiculously talented people whom I get to
learn from every day.” — {{ "alex-pandel" | team_link }}</blockquote>

### Infrastructure

*The infrastructure team helps 18F navigate the “federal compliance
architecture.” This work applies to much more than technology: it
applies to our entire operation, including how we work inside the law,
how we secure our systems, how we collect data from the public, and how
we spend money.*

make the digital services the people interact with more usable, and
useful. To influence experiences that yes, maybe even make the
interactions delightful. #AspirationalFTW To paraphrase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvAIvauhQGQ&feature=youtu.be&t=30m3s">President Obama's speech in Selma last year</a>: It's such an honor to be able to work on improving this great nation of ours.” - {{ "kara" | team_link }}</div>

“I was involved in volunteer-run e-democracy projects in the UK before I
moved to San Francisco. I watched many of my old friends & colleagues
get the UK's Government Digital Service started from afar, and found it
inspiring to see their huge success in transforming government with user
experience principles.

When my second child was born, I got a heavy dose of the American
citizen's interaction with contemporary federal bureaucracy, which I
think of as "the plastic chair and take-a-number experience". It was
doubly frustrating to navigate that while seeing an example, across the
Atlantic, of how much better things could be. So when I saw 18F gearing
up to apply the same lessons, I jumped aboard. I'm partly driven by the
value of making government more accessible to everyone, but even more
so, there's the engineer's motivation of seeing something that I know
how to fix.” - {{ "yoz" | team_link }}</div>

“I joined 18F because I wanted to try a new career path in a place that
valued autonomy and flexibility but was also dedicated to the greater
good. I came to 18F from the New York Times, which was fascinating like
many other journalism organizations but somewhat hard on people like me
who need greater work-life balance or who have to work remotely. I also
didn’t see a career path that worked for me. I have scrubbed into
several projects here mid-stream and I am always struck by how
supportive and positive my colleagues have been at making sure I
understand the work and where I fit into it. I also love the all-hands
meetings because it’s awesome to see where everybody is reporting in
from.” - {{ "jacobharris" | team_link }}</div>

that interacting with government services must be a terrible experience.
The fact that 18F represents that opportunity, alongside inspiring
colleagues while working in the open excited me even more.” -

“I joined 18F because I believe that government plays a critical role in
our society and the better it functions, the more it can better balance
the power of other large organizations. My path to 18F included almost
25 years (off and on) in software and nearly as long involved in local

“I joined 18F after I had been working in the San Francisco startup
world for a few years and felt the excitement around startups had grown
a little stale. In picking my next venture, I decided I wanted an
opportunity to make a difference for people in need. I found 18F through
the Presidential Innovation Fellowship program. I contacted somebody at
the PIF program about submitting an application, and they told me I was
too late, but I should look into 18F. I immediately liked what I saw in
18F and started the hiring process.” - {{ "marco" | team_link }}</div>

“I joined 18F because I wanted to directly build transparency in
government. I came from the Sunlight Foundation, which was a great
platform to innovate on government technology and transparency. I
started off as a reporting intern and was inspired to learn how to code,
so over the course of five years, I became a web developer. I now have
the privilege of being on the team that builds the FEC’s first API and
are building <a href="https://beta.fec.gov/">beta.fec.gov</a>.” {{ "lindsay" | team_link }}</div>

“I joined 18F because I wanted to feel that my work had a higher
purpose. I have lots of experience working in the design and tech world,
and have had the opportunity to recruit people to build large commerce
sites and develop marketing campaigns to increase profits for products,
but I have never had an opportunity to do work where the ultimate
purpose is to make people's lives better. I had previously aspired to
finding an opportunity like that, but I also wanted to be sure that the
work being done was utilizing good design and strong technology
practices. 18F is transforming government by using research, good
design, and implementing helpful and sustainable technology to develop
tools and systems that allow for the American people to have successful
interactions with the United States government. What better way to make
an impact than that? I was totally excited and thrilled at the prospect
of joining 18F.” {{ "amanda-schonfeld" | team_link }}</div>

### Business Strategy

*Intake is the process by which 18F listens to potential partners,
discusses possible solutions to their challenges, and determines
appropriate next steps. In short, it’s how we do business development
for inbound inquiries.*
