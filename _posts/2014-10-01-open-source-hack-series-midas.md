**Do you know JavaScript?  or do you have UX or visual design skills?**

**One evening can make an impact!**

18F invites designers and developers from inside and outside of government to join us for a flurry of coding and sketching.

 Midas is an open source project in active development by 18F, Health & Human Services (HHS) IDEA Lab and the State Department.  A small cross-agency team, dedicated to launching this product to empower passionate civil servants and aspiring diplomats all over the world.

## What is Midas?
[Midas is an online marketplace of skill building opportunities](http://18fblog.tumblr.com/post/91952641466/midas-a-marketplace-for-innovation-in-government) which matches people to projects that they’re passionate about.  Our goal is to foster innovation across team boundaries by connecting projects or challenges that need help within federal government agencies to people who want to work collaboratively on the solution.

"It's like a Kickstarter for people's time." –Joe Polastre at [18F Demo Day](https://speakerdeck.com/18f/innovation-toolkit-18f-demo-day-9-may-2014?slide=3)

**Designers, UX or usability folks:** We have a lot of issues tagged [design](https://github.com/18F/midas/labels/design). You can work on mockups or detailed deisgn suggestions.  If we have enough people we could even do some informal usability test sessions!

**Developers** Check out our [contribution guide](https://github.com/18F/midas/blob/devel/CONTRIBUTING.md) -- all of our code is [public domain](https://github.com/18F/midas/blob/devel/LICENSE.md).  For coders, we'd love some experts to join us, but open source is also a great place to learn and hone your skills.  Here's a list of some of the tech we use:
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)
* [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org/)
