Calling all Agile vendors...get ready!

By the end of this month, GSA will be releasing a Request for Quote
(RFQ) for the [alpha version of the Agile Delivery Services Blanket
Purchase
Agreement](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/08/creating-a-federal-marketplace-for-agile-delivery-services/).
The RFQ will be posted on GSA eBuy and, for the alpha, will be open to vendors on GSA Schedule 70.

The process for engaging industry began with a [Request for
Information](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&tab=core&id=e0807fc8a69115f0e352f6f0c135697a)
in January, followed by [a pair of Industry Day
events](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/02/12/highlights-from-the-agile-delivery-services-industry-day-events/)
in February.

Now it's time to solicit the services of those vendors who want to be a part of the digital services transformation that’s taking place within the Federal government.

For those vendors with prior Federal bidding experience, you’ll find this RFQ unique in many ways. First, we’re going to evaluate you based on a submission of a working prototype. Second, you’ll need to write more code than narrative. Third, you’ll submit pricing for [labor
categories](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/10/Labor-Category-Descriptions-for-Agile-Procurements/) specifically written for the types of agile staff that 18F needs. And, last, you’ll have to be quick &#8212; the required turnaround time to submit an RFQ response is (very) short.

We couldn’t be more excited about the weeks to come. The creation of this marketplace of Agile vendors will drive government technology forward in new and exciting ways. We welcome and look forward to your responses.
