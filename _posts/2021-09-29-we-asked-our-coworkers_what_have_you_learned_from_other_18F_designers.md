18F is a learning organization. We continue learning from each other by regularly communicating, collaborating, and sharing our ideas (in video calls, by instant messaging in docs, everywhere we can) with teammates. 

In a February 2021 design chapter meeting our then-Design Director Anne Petersen asked: “What have you learned from others at 18F?” Here’s what our team of designers had to say.

## On fostering teamwork and healthy communication

### Actively make space for others to contribute and grow.

<div class="testimonial-blockquote" markdown=1>
I’m grateful for the diversity of working styles I’ve observed at 18F, which has allowed me to grow professionally. What I found most important is really making space for others—in actions, not just words. Make room for others in meetings, presentations, and The Work. Even though I’m naturally on the quiet side, my teammates were full of encouragement and trust to let me actually put into practice skills I learned. I’m so much better for it and now I’m working on paying it forward and making room for others.

### Check in on the team’s feels.

<div class="testimonial-blockquote" markdown=1>
It’s natural to check in about how the project tasks are going but what about the people —how are they actually doing and feeling? I learned about this thoughtful exercise from my project teammate Jacklynn Pham, which helps to check in on the well-being of the people moving the project forward.

Each person on the team independently answers a set of questions and then shares and discusses their answers with the rest of the team:

- Energy. What is and what isn’t bringing you energy while working on the project?
- Focus. What would you like to do more of and how can you make room for that?
- Growth. What is one thing you’re looking to be better at?

This is an opportunity to deepen working relationships and give people a chance to discuss how to adjust the way they work to support the strengths, energy levels, and growth opportunities of everyone on the team.

### How do you want people to feel after a meeting?

<div class="testimonial-blockquote" markdown=1>
Ask questions like, “what do you want to get out of this meeting?” or “what do we want to accomplish in our time together?” to elicit the team’s response, and ask yourself, _‘How do we want them to feel at the end of this meeting?’_ This builds trust and empowerment. Doing self-reflection first and sharing it later with others helps people talk about their “feels,” which can otherwise be hard to say out loud.

### Avoid meeting overload and preserve uninterrupted focus time.

<div class="testimonial-blockquote" markdown=1>
Meetings can be a great way to collaborate, get the team aligned, and just check in and chat with coworkers, but do you ever look at your calendar and get scared? _Help help help, meeting overload._ (Me, too.) It’s important to preserve some uninterrupted time to find a focus flow and make progress on tasks. Feeling productive is not only good for your work, it also contributes to daily joy, motivation, and a sense of progress.

Fellow 18F content designers Malaika Carpenter and Amanda Costello had both mentioned to me at various points, “try doing a meeting audit.” This means: list out all your meetings and ask yourself a few questions about each meeting to make sure they’re still a good use of everyone’s time, and restructure them or even consider dropping them if they’re not.

- What’s most useful about this meeting? 
- What’s less useful about this meeting? 
- Do we want to keep it at this time? Reschedule to a different time? Make it shorter/longer? 
- Anything else you’re wishing for this meeting?

You can do this solo or as a team. My project team ran this exercise after about nine months of working together (so we had plenty of time to judge whether our regular meetings were best serving us) and it was really helpful. We dropped a weekly meeting that was no longer necessary, made one shorter, made one optional for certain folks, and it magically freed up longer focus blocks for our whole team. We even considered a no-meetings Friday to really maximize focus time.

### One team, one dream.

<div class="testimonial-blockquote" markdown=1>
Our teams are cross-functional by design. Everybody and their perspective matters to the success of the team. Clear communication and regular feedback are vital to make sure we stay in sync as a team.

### “Foster relationships, over-communicate, and be ready to pass the baton to the next person.”

<div class="testimonial-blockquote" markdown=1>
I learned from fellow UX designer Melissa Braxton how to foster relationships and how to over-communicate. This means regular 1:1s with teammates but also research session debriefs, weekly ships, biweekly retros, and regular project health checks (we do them biweekly for all 18F projects as a quick 5-minute form to flag any issues). We’ve documented many of these practices in the [TTS Handbook](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/general-information-and-resources/how-we-collaborate/). I also came to understand that our work isn’t going away. It’s a relay race: take it as far as you can but be ready to pass the baton to the next person.

## On user research and facilitation

### Our job is facilitation, not production.

<div class="testimonial-blockquote" markdown=1>
We have a big design team at 18F, and we get to see how different people approach a problem. I’m grateful for getting to see so many ways of working, especially around facilitation. Our job is _facilitation_ not production; facilitation gets you to production. At 18F I’ve learned how we can bring our partners and their users  into the design process and share that design responsibility. That’s the real work.

### Make people feel comfortable before user interviews.

<div class="testimonial-blockquote" markdown=1>
I learned the importance of making people feel comfortable before user interviews from fellow UX designer Melissa Braxton. We want people to feel comfortable so that they’ll speak candidly about their experiences. We rely on their candor and openness in order to properly assess and address their challenges and needs so we can offer the appropriate solutions.
