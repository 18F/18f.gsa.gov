As 18F grows, so does
the [18F Consulting](https://18f.gsa.gov/consulting/) team. The way we
operate is to roll-up our sleeves alongside our federal partners and
help them solve the biggest challenges facing their agency. These
challenges range from reducing the disability claims backlog to giving
Americans new ways to save for retirement. They’re simply too important
*not* to be solved or improved.

To this end, our
consulting team offers federal agencies a variety of high-impact
services. Some are short-term, from two days to four weeks, such as
[agile
workshops](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/02/11/a-story-of-an-agile-workshop/),
[protosketching](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/06/protosketch/), and
[RFP
ghostwriting](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/30/new-rfp-ghostwriting-service-to-improve-contract-success/).
Others are mid- to long-term, from four to 12 months, such as agile
acquisitions, [cloud
migrations](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/06/22/avoiding-cloudfall/), and
[vendor marketplace
development](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/08/creating-a-federal-marketplace-for-agile-delivery-services/).
Given the significant demand for our services, we’re looking to our grow
team in these specific areas: [engagement
manager](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/who-we-are-hiring/positions/engagement-manager/),
[design and product
strategist](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/who-we-are-hiring/positions/design-and-product-strategist/),
[technical
architect](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/who-we-are-hiring/positions/technical-architect/),
[practical
dev](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/who-we-are-hiring/positions/practical-dev/),
[data
architect](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/who-we-are-hiring/positions/data-architect/),
and [acquisition
specialist](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/who-we-are-hiring/positions/acquisition-specialist/).

## A little more about how 18F Consulting works

As part of 18F, the Consulting team helps federal agencies adopt modern
approaches to managing and delivering digital services. We're a
cross-functional team of digital specialists, with wide-ranging
experience inside and outside the federal government. Whether it’s with
an agency’s program manager, contracting officer, lawyer, or chief
information officer, we partner with them to deliver the greatest value
possible to the public.

**Whom we work for and with.** First and foremost, we work for the
American people. Your friends, family, and neighbors. The woman in front
of you at the grocery story. The guy on the bus who gives up his seat
for a young family. We're here to make sure the system works for them.

**How we work.** We’re all over the country, so the need for
face-to-face time means all our meetings are video unless otherwise
agreed upon. We also work across the different 18F Consulting teams, so
you’ll often be working with, and sometimes leading, cross-functional
teams.

## How we talk about our open jobs

Unlike a traditional job description — which can seem as lengthy as a
Broadway overture — we create performance profiles. Performance profiles
focus on what the person needs to do, as opposed to the experience a
person needs to have. It highlights what the job entails and what’s
expected in the day-to-day cadence of the role.

**Performance profile for technical architect**
>
 As a member of the 18F Consulting team, Technical Architects face the daunting challenge of bridging the gap between two technological
 worlds within the federal government — the old and the new. In the
 old, federal agencies depend heavily on legacy technology stacks, data
 silos, and tightly-coupled systems to support critical operations. In
 fact, it isn’t uncommon to come across systems built using Delphi or
 COBOL. In the new, agencies are exploring the use of more “modern”
 technologies such as Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and cloud platforms as
 well as architectural patterns such as API-first design and
 microservices. Your job — and it will be a tough one — is to help
 federal agencies transition to more modern technical environments that
 would earn the admiration of any engineer. By doing so, you’ll greatly
 increase the government’s overall capacity to spend scarce IT budget
 resources on innovative projects, as opposed to “keep the lights on”
 activities.

>
 You’ll work alongside a small, yet focused team of other 18F
 Consulting specialists. They are experts in design, product strategy,
 technical architecture, software engineering, data science, and
 procurement. In addition, you will be part of the broader network of
 all of 18F, which includes over a 100 digital specialists.

>
 You’ll work on different types of projects that could come from any
 federal agency. Some projects will improve services that millions of
 people use and others might be important processes that a few hundred
 use, but in turn affects how government works. Depending on the nature
 of the work and the methods that you use, you can affect change in
 just a few months, and sometimes in just a few days.
