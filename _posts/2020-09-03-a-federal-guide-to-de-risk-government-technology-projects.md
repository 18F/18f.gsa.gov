ast August, we released a [de-risking government technology field guide for states](https://github.com/18F/derisking-gov-tech/blob/master/State%20Field%20Guide%20-%20Agile%20Budgeting%20%26%20Oversight.pdf). The guide offers state staff with tools to make custom technology projects more successful. We documented over a dozen best practices, including budgeting for software as an operational expense, limiting contract size, measuring success iteratively, and hiring in-house tech talent.

Today, we’re proud to announce a second field guide, de-risking technology field guide for federal agencies. The guide provides actionable recommendations to address the common challenges agencies face when adopting agile and user-centered design methodologies. Ultimately, the goal is to help teams reduce risk and improve outcomes for the agency’s end-users.

Each section provides straight-forward recommendations and templates for agency staff to address common pitfalls in planning and implementing modern software development projects. These recommendations include considerations in build-or-buy decisions, how to write a contract for agile software development, what to look for in a high-quality contractor proposal, and meaningful metrics for agile development.

The field guide is written for federal agency cross-functional teams delivering IT services to their users – senior executives, program managers, product owners, senior procurement executives, contracting officers, IT managers, and funding officials.

This work was written by [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) and funded by the Technology Transformation Services’ (TTS) [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov/) program, housed within GSA’s Federal Acquisition Service. To inform this work our researchers collected information across TTS project work with agencies, researched federal policies and reports, examined lessons learned from failed IT projects, and interviewed agencies to uncover common pain points.

The field guide is available now, both online and in PDF format. We will continue to edit and add to this handbook as we learn more.

If you have questions, suggestions, or any kind of feedback, we’d be happy to [hear from you](mailto:18F@gsa.gov).
