18F recently introduced its [series of
guides](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/05/28/18F-guides/), a collection of
best practices for our internal project teams. As Mike Bland writes in
his post describing the guides, “Though these guides currently carry the
18F brand, the intention is to spread the use and cultivation of the
material throughout the broader [U.S. Digital
Service](https://wh.gov/usds/) effort.”

To that end, we’re proud to announce the release of our [**18F Content Guide**](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/index.html), a
comprehensive handbook to help content creators on our team (and, we
hope, elsewhere) create more direct, accessible, and compelling written
works. Per the [Plain Writing Act of
2010](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/plLaw/), agencies across government
(including the [General Services
Administration](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/298757)) have been
working hard to improve the clarity and accessibility of their content.
We’re thrilled to be contributing to this ongoing mission.

## *You* are our intended audience 

We wrote this guide for content creators of all stripes: content
designers and strategists, bloggers, comms folks, and anyone else who
has a hand in the production of written works.

We realize that content creators bring to the table different strengths
and approach the creative process from different contexts. In
organizations without formalized content standards, these divergences
can cause tension. Adopting a content style guide — especially one a
team modifies substantially to better meet its needs — is a good way to
set a baseline from which to work. Setting such a baseline allows teams
to shift their focus from debating capitalizations (to cite a common
example, and one we’re all too familiar with) to producing top-quality
content in a timely manner.

Our guide is for everyone, and we’ve written it to be as inclusive as
possible. We use plain language and a friendly, informative tone to
appeal to the widest possible audience.

## How to use the guide

We’ve divided our guide into easy-to-navigate sections titled after the
topics they cover. Though some people might prefer to read the guide
from start to finish, we encourage users to skip around a bit, finding
topics of immediate interest and continuing to browse from there.

Additionally, we’ve also included links to other great style guides that
informed our work — they’re listed at the end of the guide in the
References section. And we owe much to [Gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/),
whose style guide we used as a jumping-off point for our own.

## The guide is a living thing

Though we’re proud of the work we’ve done, we’re equally thrilled at the
prospect of folks making copies of our guide and changing them however
they like.

We’re of the mind that the best style guides are living documents —
modifiable, customizable frameworks that change with the organization
they’re a part of. Content guides exist to help people easily convey
their organization’s values; holding on to guides that no longer reflect
organizational values can lead to the creation of unclear or inaccurate
content, which is what we’re all trying to avoid.

All this is to say we hope you’ll take this guide and use it as you see
fit, especially if that use involves revisions and reconfigurations.

## Now taking suggestions

If you’ve got thoughts on how we might improve the guide, please

from you!
