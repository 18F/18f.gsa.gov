Last month, content strategist and UX designer Natalie Kurz [presented at
18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/11/03/content-strategy-for-all-insights-from-cfpb-natalie-kurz/). Currently a Technology and Innovation Fellow at the [Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/),
Kurz has spent more than 15 years helping clients create, maintain, and
promote beautiful, brand-adherent content.

Prior to her presentation, we had the chance to chat with Kurz via email
about her experience working with different types of content, her
predictions for the field, and the collaborative approaches she
recommends. To get more of her insights into successful content-strategy
practices, read on.

**1. During the past decade, digital content creation and strategy have
become more prominent as design disciplines. What content-related trends
do you see on the horizon?**

I think there will be a big trend toward more personalized, adaptive
content as companies begin to realize that users want to have a full
experience regardless of what device they may be using to view content.
Users have come to expect more than a watered-down “mobile” experience.
And as content delivery platforms continue to evolve, I think we’ll see
a trend toward chunked, reusable content that is more easily displayed
on any screen size. Which also means we’ll see an uptick in content
modeling, metadata definitions, and CMS design to accommodate the
content in a more reusable way.

**2. On a more personal note: You have a background in journalism and
spent years creating health, beauty, and lifestyle content. What spurred
your shift in focus from (primarily) writing and editing to UX? What
difficulties, if any, did you encounter as you made this shift, and how
did you work through them?**

I actually started in UX before getting my masters in journalism; I just
didn’t know that was what I was doing! My first job out of undergrad was
working in the collections department as a project manager of Sara Lee
Bakery Group. While there, I saw a lot of inefficiencies within their
software system, which was built off SAP. So I worked with a few
developers to improve the system’s workflow, allowing collectors to
better track their efforts over time. It was UX design, but that wasn’t
even a phrase on my radar!

I left that job to pursue a passion in journalism. In subsequent jobs, I
would be hired to write online content and in the process would make
suggestions regarding user flows, design patterns and overall
interactions that I noticed felt “off.” I was fortunate to work for
teams that embraced my self-taught skills and let me expand my job
description by learning about usability testing and creating wireframes.
I started referring to myself as a UX designer and was then hired as a
director of a growing web development agency to essentially develop an
entire UX and content strategy practice. That was my crash course in the
breadth of what UX means.

It ended up being a very natural transition for me. I think that’s
because in every job I’ve ever had, I’ve gravitated toward solving
problems, which is a core tenant of good UX work. Define the problem,
then solve it. It’s also at the heart of being a journalist — tease out
the problem and define what the story is really about. Both professions
are also heavily reliant on empathy, listening, and organizing
information. To be honest, the biggest conflict I encountered along the
way was myself. I spent many years wavering between calling myself a
user experience designer and a content strategist. Until I decided I
really could be both.

**3. You’ve mentioned that few folks in writing-related fields receive
formal training as content strategists, yet many of us are expected to
create content strategies. A few questions on this topic: Do you feel
that certain writing-rich backgrounds lend themselves more to the
transition to content strategy (for example, journalists make better
content strategists)? If so, which backgrounds, and why?**

I think there are a few key traits that are essential to being a good
content strategist, but I don’t believe those traits are limited to any
specific background or profession. You have to be a good writer. While
content strategy doesn’t necessarily equate to content creation, in
reality both tasks usually fall to a single lucky person. But creating
content strategies does require a deep understanding of language — the
structure, the connotations, the musicality of words. You need to be
able to tap into literary techniques for creating voice and tone,
identify when to use first or third person and determine if your brand
should use personal pronouns or not.

You also have to have a burning, innate desire to analyze, organize,
label and group things. Much of content strategy is the “behind the
scenes” stuff of creating giant spreadsheets, identifying content types
and metadata, building content models and determining the who, when and
how of the content lifecycle and governance.

I think that’s why we see a lot of journalists, information architects
and library scientists making the switch to content strategy. The skills
that made them good at those jobs are the same ones required in content
strategy. But it doesn’t matter what field you come from. And as there
becomes more awareness around the importance of content strategy, we’re
starting to see degree programs that are more focused on the discipline,
which is fantastic.

**4. What are your thoughts on how best to integrate a content
strategist into a cross-functional product team? Any thoughts on how a
content strategist’s work could fit into the agile cycle?**

Ok, first the easy answer to the first question. Content strategy is an
umbrella that sits on top of your project, much like project management.
It is a crucial piece of every stage. Many folks operate under the
assumption that the strategy gets created during the discovery phase,
some content is written at the beginning of design and then that content
resource rolls onto another project. I’ve seen this fail 100% of the
time.

The key thing with incorporating content strategy into an agile cycle is
to identify a content resource from day one that will remain a permanent
member of the team until the project closes. It’s not enough to have a
writer jump into the middle of sprint seven to “write some content that
goes here.” That’s not content strategy. That’s copywriting as an
afterthought. Much of the heavy lifting of content strategy is planning
— you can’t help determine a train’s course if you’re expected to vault
yourself onto it while it’s moving and is only a few hours away from its
destination.

Within every sprint, there should be some content strategy work going
on. Content audits, analysis, messaging, research, defining user goals
(in tandem with UX work), creating content models and metadata
libraries, writing editorial guidelines, creating a governance plan.
There’s certainly enough to do!

And there are ways to make the content work more agile. Think small.
Break out a key user task (like the checkout process) or business
requirement (this section is what drives revenue) and focus on the
content surrounding that thing first. Use a rolling audit process, so
you aren’t diving into “all the things” at once. Just like the mentality
of “minimal viable product” you can create a “minimal viable strategy.”
There are so many tasks and deliverables associated with content
strategy, but you will never have the time or budget to do them all.
Pick the things that will have the biggest impact on the project — or
biggest impact within the current sprint — and put your focus there. For
instance, if you’re honing in on the event section, a content audit may
not be as helpful as modeling the event content type.

Also, I can’t stress enough how important it is to test wires and
prototypes with actual content. Get real feedback on the language, tone,
clarity, structure, placement within the design. Include questions in
your testing scripts that are focused specifically on the content. I’ve
seen award-winning designs fail because the content was never vetted
with users and it failed to communicate the intended message.

**5. What are some of the biggest barriers to being successful as a
content strategist on a software team?**

I think the biggest one is getting picked for the team in the first
place. In my experience, there is a collective sigh of relief from the
team once you’re there, because it means they don’t have to struggle
through the process by themselves any longer. I think software teams
understand the value of content strategy and are just hungry for people
to do it.

**6. Finally, what piece of advice would you offer to a new content
designer or content strategist?**

I’m a huge fan of learning by doing. Don’t be afraid to just dive in.
Volunteer to handle content on your team if no one else is doing it —
more than likely your initiative and help will be valued because you’re
filling a vital need.

Get educated on the topic. Read the books from thought leaders. Attend
some workshops or conferences for hands-on and practical experience.

Finally, help educate your stakeholders and teammates on what content
strategy is and what it isn’t — it’s an ongoing process to plan for the
creation and delivery of content, not just a set of deliverables or
replacing “lorem ipsum” with actual words. It should never be an
afterthought.
