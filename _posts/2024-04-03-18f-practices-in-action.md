18F just completed a successful two-year partnership with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) https://get.gov/about/. Together with an excellent vendor team, we built a https://get.gov/posts/2024-01-31-new-way-to-get-a-.gov/. The project included three phases: discovery, build, and launch.
