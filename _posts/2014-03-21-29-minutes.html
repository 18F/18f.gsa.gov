<p>I want to relate a great little thing that happened here at <a href="http://gsa.gov/">18th and F</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>At 11am yesterday morning, members of the GSA.gov team, Sarah Hyder and Patrick Son, met with Hillary Hartley, Alison Rowland, and me to talk about how to integrate <a href="https://fbopen.gsa.gov">FBOpen</a> into GSA's mobile website, <a href="http://m.gsa.gov">m.gsa.gov</a>, on its <a href="http://m.gsa.gov/m/#!/buy-sell/how-to-sell">How To Sell to the Government</a>" page.</p>

<p>At 11:29am, we had working code up and running on their staging server.</p>
<p>We get so used to things taking multiple meetings, multiple days/weeks/months, and lots of back and forth. A couple stars aligned to make this one easy, but bottom line: it took 29 minutes to go from “How could we do this?” to a working code integration that went live the same afternoon.</p>
<p>I thought you should hear about what can happen when you get two simple, clean GSA codebases in a room together. This is what gets me excited about working at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> every day!</p>
<p>Kudos especially to Sarah, Patrick and their team. In <a href="http://m.gsa.gov/">m.gsa.gov</a> they've built something on a nice, flexible, modern architecture that's amenable to the same rapid prototyping and iteration that 18F is all about.</p>
