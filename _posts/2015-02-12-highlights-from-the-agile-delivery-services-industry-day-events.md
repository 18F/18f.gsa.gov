Tuesday, February 3 was a big day for GSA, and for me personally. In the
morning, I had the incredible experience of meeting with President Obama
in the Oval Office to talk about the work that's going into developing
the [*Agile Delivery Services
marketplace*](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/08/creating-a-federal-marketplace-for-agile-delivery-services/).

While that discussion was going on, 18F and GSA’s [*Office of Integrated
Technology Services*](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105150) (ITS)
held a pair of Industry Day events for our upcoming Agile Delivery
Services blanket purchase agreement (BPA). More than 700 people registered
for the events, showing just how much interest there is from the private
sector in this new BPA.

During both the online webinar and the in-person gathering at the GSA
Auditorium, GSA’s expert panel — consisting of 18F’s Noah Kunin, Aaron
Snow, Russ Unger, and myself and ITS’ Hassan Harris and Giovanni
Onwuchekwa — laid out why we’re creating this BPA and how we envision
the marketplace working.

The audience raised a number of questions for the panel, and offered
some great suggestions, many of which we’ve now decided to incorporate
in the upcoming Request for Quote (RFQ). If you couldn’t make the
webinar, you can [*view a recording of
it*](http://gsafas.adobeconnect.com/p9gcfd4n0rs/), and we should have
video of the afternoon session shortly.

It was great to see so many people in the GSA auditorium to hear keynote
speakers Adam Neufeld (GSA Chief of Staff), Kay Ely (Director of GSA IT
Schedule 70), Greg Godbout (Executive Director of 18F), and Ryan
Panchadsaram (U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer) discuss the value of
this BPA to GSA and the government at large.

To underscore how unique this initiative is, several media outlets
covered the events, including [*Federal News
Radio*](http://www.federalnewsradio.com/?nid=65&sid=3793757&pid=0&page=1)
(which also live tweeted the event),
[*NextGov*](http://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2015/02/agile-gsa/104577/),
[*FedScoop*](http://fedscoop.com/18f-calling-for-industry-to-help-with-overwhelming-demand),
and
[*FierceGovernmentIT*](http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/gsa-moves-quickly-agile-bpa-response-agency-demand/2015-02-09?utm_campaign=AddThis&utm_medium=AddThis&utm_source=twitter#.VNkm7VykWX4.twitter).

The events also attracted some positive tweets, including [*this
one*](https://twitter.com/Ken_2scientists/status/562630842158039040)
from [*@Ken\_2scientists*](https://twitter.com/Ken_2scientists):
“Listening to the @18F Agile Delivery Services Industry Day Q&A: I don't
think I've ever been more optimistic about our government ...”

On behalf of the 18F and ITS team, thanks to all the vendors who
responded to the [*Request for

(more than 280) and participated in the Industry Day events.
