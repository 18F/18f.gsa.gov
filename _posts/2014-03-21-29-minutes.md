I want to relate a great little thing that happened here at [18th and
F](http://gsa.gov/) yesterday.

At 11am yesterday morning, members of the GSA.gov team, Sarah Hyder and
Patrick Son, met with Hillary Hartley, Alison Rowland, and me to talk
about how to integrate [FBOpen](https://fbopen.gsa.gov) into GSA's
mobile website, [m.gsa.gov](http://m.gsa.gov), on its [How To Sell to
the Government](http://m.gsa.gov/m/#!/buy-sell/how-to-sell)" page.

At 11:29am, we had working code up and running on their staging server.

We get so used to things taking multiple meetings, multiple
days/weeks/months, and lots of back and forth. A couple stars aligned to
make this one easy, but bottom line: it took 29 minutes to go from “How
could we do this?” to a working code integration that went live the same
afternoon.

I thought you should hear about what can happen when you get two simple,
clean GSA codebases in a room together. This is what gets me excited
about working at [18F]({{ site.baseurl }}/) every day!

Kudos especially to Sarah, Patrick and their team. In
[m.gsa.gov](http://m.gsa.gov/) they've built something on a nice,
flexible, modern architecture that's amenable to the same rapid
prototyping and iteration that 18F is all about.
