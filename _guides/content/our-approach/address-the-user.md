Content on government sites often makes a direct appeal to the public to get involved or take action.

Address the user as _you_ whenever possible. For example:

> You can email us at [18F@gsa.gov](mailto:18F@gsa.gov) or find us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/18f).

> Learn more about starting your MyRA account.

If you’re creating content for multiple users—such as patients and their caregivers—address the primary user as _you_ and refer to secondary users by their roles or titles.

We recommend against using the word _citizens_ when talking about the public. See the [inclusive language]({{ "/our-style/inclusive-language/#nationality" | relative_url }}) section for further guidance.
