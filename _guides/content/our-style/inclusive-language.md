The words we use can make the difference between forging positive connections or creating distance in our personal and professional lives. Particularly in writing, impact is more important than intent.

As we build government services, we want to ensure they are accessible and welcoming to everyone who needs to use them. Inclusive language helps us to be more accurate and build trust with our users.

This guidance is influenced by the [Conscious Style Guide](http://consciousstyleguide.com/), which is an excellent resource for learning more about the conversations behind terms, categories, and concepts. Other resources we used:

- [Diversity Style Guide](http://www.diversitystyleguide.com/)
- [Disability Language Style Guide](http://ncdj.org/style-guide/)
- [Associated Press Stylebook](http://www.apstylebook.com/)
- [Syracuse University Disability Cultural Center Language Guide](http://sudcc.syr.edu/resources/language-guide.html)

This page is not exhaustive, but aims to provide principles, resources, and specific suggestions for writing and talking about diverse groups of people.

## Ability and disability

Every person is a whole person — no matter how they interact with the world. Focus on what they need to do, what tools they use, and avoid making assumptions. If a person’s situation, medical condition, illness, or injury is relevant to the content, be as specific as possible and avoid inserting value judgements about their circumstance (for example, use _has multiple sclerosis_, not _is afflicted with_ or _suffers from_).

Just like with language around race, gender, or other identities, it’s always best to ask people how they identify rather than assuming. For help finding appropriate or accurate language, see the [Disability Language Style Guide](http://ncdj.org/style-guide/) from the National Center on Disability and Journalism.

- Avoid describing people as _disabled_, _handicapped_, or _confined to a wheelchair_.
- Avoid terms that contribute to stigmas around disability or mental illness: _crazy_, _dumb_, _lame_, _insane_, _psycho_, _schizophrenic_, or _stupid_.
- Avoid terms that contribute to stigmas around sensory disabilities: _blind spot_ or _tone deaf_.

## Age

Avoid referring to someone’s age, unless it’s relevant to what you're writing about (for example, when referring to benefits that are available to people of certain ages).

- Don’t use women or older relatives as substitute for _novice_ or _beginner_. For example, don’t say something is [so simple your mother can use it](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/So_simple,_your_mother_could_do_it).
- We prefer _older person_ or _senior_ to _elderly_.

## Gender and sexuality

Make content gender neutral wherever possible, and strive to write in a [gender-fair](http://www.ncte.org/positions/statements/genderfairuseoflang) way. If you’re writing about a hypothetical person or if you’re unsure of the person’s pronouns, use _they_ or _them_ instead of _he/she_.

Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender bias, such as irrelevant descriptions of appearance.

Use descriptors of gender identity or sexual orientation as modifiers, not as nouns (for example, _transgender person_, _cisgender person_, or _lesbian woman_). Avoid guessing sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. When in doubt, either reconsider the need to include this information or ask the person you’re referring to how they identify and what terms they prefer.

- Use _different sex_ instead of _opposite sex_ (because this recognizes gender as a spectrum, rather than a binary).
- We support using _they_ or _their_ as singular pronouns.
- Avoid _guys_ as a way to refer to mixed-gender groups.
- Don't make assumptions about marital or family relationships (for example, use _spouse_ or _partner_ instead of _husband_ and _wife_; use _parent_ instead of _mother_ and _father_).

For more detailed guidance, see the [National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association Style Guide](http://www.nlgja.org/stylebook/terminology/) or the [GLAAD Media Reference Guide](https://www.glaad.org/reference/).

## Nationality

Avoid using _citizen_ as a generic term for people who live in the United States. Many government programs serve non-citizens and individuals with a wide range of immigration and visa statuses.

- How you refer to the public is largely dependent on context. Feel free to choose from any of these words: _people_, _the public_, _users_, or _folks_.

- Be as specific as possible. Depending on the situation, you may want to say something like _people who need healthcare_ or _people who need to access government services online_.

- Use _citizens_ for information related to U.S. citizenship, for example, when describing who is eligible to vote in federal elections.

- Be careful with _Americans_ or _the American public_. These terms are [ambiguous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_United_States_citizens) and are often used as synonyms for _citizens_. In most cases, _the public_ is equally clear and more inclusive. That said, referring to _Americans_ or _the American people_ can be useful if you want to inspire readers or take a more patriotic tone.

## Race, ethnicity, and religion

Avoid using words, images, or situations that reinforce racial, ethnic, or religious stereotypes (even stereotypes that may appear to be positive). Avoid the term _non-white_, or other terms that treat whiteness as a default.

Don’t make assumptions: ask how people identify themselves, and be aware of complexities within racial, ethnic, and religious identities. For example, not all Arabs are Muslim, and many nationalities and ethnicities include various religious practices and traditions.

When referring to a person’s race or ethnicity, use adjectives, not nouns (for example, _a Hispanic person_, not _a Hispanic_).
