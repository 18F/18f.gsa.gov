If you take nothing else from all these words, take this. Agile is not a checklist, or a methodology, or a series of rituals. Agile is a way of thinking and a way of attacking problems. Embrace mistakes, learn, and keep trying. Mess up and learn again and again and again. Cut your losses. Fail forward fast. It’s okay. You won’t get fired. You’re learning.

_That_ is Agile.
