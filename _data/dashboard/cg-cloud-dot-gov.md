description: cloud.gov includes a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) specifically built for government, based on the open source Cloud Foundry. It provides a secure, scalable platform for teams to build and host their application or website. It can help development teams work faster and cheaper by handling much of their deployment complexity. The cloud.gov platform is currently in a small pilot program, but we will be expanding access over time.

impact: cloud.gov gives government teams the ability to develop, run, and manage web applications without the complexity and cost of building and maintaining infrastructure.

tagline: Develop, run, and manage web applications without the complexity and cost of maintaining infrastructure.
