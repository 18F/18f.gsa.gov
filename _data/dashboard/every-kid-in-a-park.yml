description: In 2015, President Obama formally announced the Every Kid in a Park program, which provides fourth graders and their families with free access to more than 2,000 federally-managed sites. 18F worked with the Department of the Interior to create the programâ€™s website, which was written at a fourth grade level with the help of fourth graders.

impact: Designed for and by fourth graders, the Every Kid in a Park website has issued tens of thousands of passes since it launched in July 2015.

tagline: We designed a website that gives fourth graders and their families free access to more than 2,000 federally-managed sites.
