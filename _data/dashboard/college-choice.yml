description: In September, 18F worked with USDS and the Department of Education on College Scorecard, a clearinghouse to provide the clearest, most accessible, and reliable national data on college cost, graduation, debt, and post-college earnings.

impact: Millions of college applicants, and those who support and advise them, can now make more informed decisions based on data related to college cost, graduation rates, debt, and post-degree earnings.

tagline: We helped build an API and site that helps people make more informed decisions based on data related to college cost, graduation rates, debt, and post-degree earnings.
