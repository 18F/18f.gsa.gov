description: This repository contains minimal "hello world" applications for a handful of different languages/frameworks for testing deployment to [Cloud Foundry](http://www.cloudfoundry.org/) ("CF"), though they may be useful for other things. Think of it like [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/), but server-side.
