lead: Let’s work together to design services that empower your team, better serve the public, and tackle the big problems facing your agency.
---

We can work with you to explore and define a variety of problems, and then we can help you build or buy a solution.

Because of our limited resources, 18F is not able to take on every project that agencies propose. We select our projects through a qualification and evaluation process led by our Agency Partnerships Team. If you and 18F decide that we’re the right fit for a project and we have the necessary time and resources, we’ll work with you to draft the necessary documents to begin our partnership. You can read more about how we work with other agencies in our [Partnership Playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/partnership-playbook/).

18F is a cost-recoverable office, which means that we do not receive appropriated funds from Congress and must charge our partner agencies to cover our costs. Funding is set up through [Interagency Agreements](https://pages.18f.gov/iaa-forms/).
