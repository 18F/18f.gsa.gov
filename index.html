            18F is a new unit within the General Services Administration that builds effective, user-centric digital services focused on the interaction between government and the people and businesses it serves. This digital hub will encompass the Presidential Innovation Fellows program and GSA’s newly launched digital delivery team to help agencies solve the nation’s biggest problems through digital and web services.

            The not-so-secret mission of 18F is not to build websites, or even to build tools and services for agencies and the public. It is to show that successful technology development is possible in government, to spend orders of magnitude less doing it and to thereby transform the relationship between citizens and their government.
