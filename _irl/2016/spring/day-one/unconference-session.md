An “unconference” session is one in which attendees suggest the topics; in this case, 18F staff proposed and voted on topics before the event. The first day covered the following topics:

#### Transformation in the trenches
<ul style="list-style: none">
<li>What skills do you need for technical projects that are not technical skills? And how do you address possible “red flags” when working with outside groups?</li>
</ul>

#### Meeting facilitation and leadership
<ul style="list-style: none">
<li>Share and discuss tactics to make your meetings more successful.</li>
</ul>

#### Sharing our mission
<ul style="list-style: none">
<li>What can we do to ensure 18F projects reach a wide audience and that we can identify other innovative work happening at all levels of government in the United States?</li>
</ul>

#### Resume-crafting
<ul style="list-style: none">
<li>How do you effectively review a government resume and cover letter as a member of 18F?</li>
</ul>

#### Etiquette for remote teams
<ul style="list-style: none">
<li>What are ways we can better manage our culture through remote communication channels?</li>
</ul>

#### Diversity Working Group
