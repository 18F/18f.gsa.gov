day: 1

The first of two sessions where 18F team members took time to meet the people they work with but rarely see in-person. We recently re-organized our teams and added new business units. Many of groups took these two sessions to devise strategy, make action plans, and write mission statements and charters.

Teams that met during this time:

* Acquisition services
* Strategy
* Custom partner solutions
* Experience Design
* Engineering
* Learn and outreach
* Operations
* Product Management chapter
* Products and Platforms business unit
* Talent
* Transformation services
