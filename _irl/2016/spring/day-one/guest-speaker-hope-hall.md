Our first guest speaker of the conference was Presidential Videographer, Hope Hall.

Hall talked about the importance of having empathy for people in unfamiliar situations because she is often in the position of filming people meeting with President Obama, and her video camera only compounds how nervous people feel. At 18F, we’re often in meetings where we’re suggesting ways to build digital services that are very different from the norm. Having empathy for where our partners are coming from, and the expertise they bring to the table, can help us create a stronger relationship and deliver better services to the public.
