The 18F Coffee House was a half an hour of time each day where up to five team members demonstrated skills and shared personal stories with the rest of their colleagues. On the first day, one colleague read an excerpt from a science fiction story they wrote, another showed their creative side by showing a film they made, and another performed a dance they had rehearsed.
