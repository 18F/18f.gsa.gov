An “unconference” session is one in which attendees suggest the topics; in this case, 18F staff proposed and voted on topics before the event. The first day covered the following topics:

### Transformation in the trenches

What skills do you need for technical projects that are not technical skills? And how do you address possible “red flags” when working with outside groups?

### Meeting facilitation and leadership

Share and discuss tactics to make your meetings more successful.

### Sharing our mission

What can we do to ensure 18F projects reach a wide audience and that we can identify other innovative work happening at all levels of government in the United States?

### Resume-crafting

How do you effectively review a government resume and cover letter as a member of 18F?

### Etiquette for remote teams

What are ways we can better manage our culture through remote communication channels?

### Diversity Working Group

Learn how to be more inclusive and conscious of your word choices.
