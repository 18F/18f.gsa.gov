8F team members took time to meet with the people they work with but rarely see. We recently re-organized our teams and added new business units, and many of them took these two sessions to devise strategy, make action plans, and write mission statements and charters.

This was the second of two 45 minute blocks reserved for this purpose. The teams that met are listed on day 1.
