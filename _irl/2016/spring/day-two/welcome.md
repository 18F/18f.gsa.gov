Back in GSA Auditorium to kick off day two. Welcomed the staff back to the GSA Auditorium for lightning talks, and the third speaker, Rebecca Alban Hoffberger, founder of the Visionary Art Museum.

### Lightning talks (short talks presented by team members)

* **Gathering unmoderated feedback:** What is unmoderated feedback? How do you use it for usability testing? Working examples were provided.
* **Using Wikipedia well:** Have you checked the Wikipedia article about your 18F project, agency partner, or area of expertise? We usually can't directly fix Wikipedia articles related to our work, due to Wikipedia’s “conflict of interest” policy. Basics of how editing Wikipedia works and what its policies allow.
* **Overview of Lean UX and Lean Product Design:** An overview of lean UX principles and how you can try it out in your own work.
* **Partnership, policy, and prototyping:** Prototyping is more than a solid user-centered delivery strategy. It’s a vehicle to combat resistance and helps you socialize your approach.
* **Learning about presidential transitions:** What kinds of changes will happen over the next few months and how will that affect (or not affect) our relationship with our partners on active projects?
* **Transformation a to positive outlook on life:** A motivational talk from one of our employees on how he changed his perspective on life. Key takeaway: Treat everyone like humans, give them the best experience possible. You never know how you can impact them.
