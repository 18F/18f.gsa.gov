/*

We compare all posts to all other posts to determine how similar
they are, and use the top few posts as the "related posts" on a blog
post page.

SimilarityScores is sort of a table of similarity scores, keeping track
of how similar each post is to all other posts. We don't compare a post
to itself, because we never want a post to be its own related post.

  |        | Post 1 | Post 2 | Post 3 |
  |:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
  | Post 1 |        |   12   |    8   |
  | Post 2 |    4   |        |    4   |
  | Post 3 |    2   |    4   |        |
