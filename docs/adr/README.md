# ADR Process

We use [Architecture Decision Records](https://18f.gsa.gov/2021/07/06/architecture_decision_records_helpful_now_invaluable_later/) (ADR's) to track architectural decisions for the codebase.

In order to ensure that decisions are reviewed and implemented in a timely manner, use this process:

- To create an ADR, create a file in this directory and open a pull request. (Review [best practices](https://18f.gsa.gov/2021/07/06/architecture_decision_records_helpful_now_invaluable_later/) for writing an ADR.)
- Review ADRâ€™s like any other PR. Any stakeholders or decision-makers for the ADR should be tagged to the PR as reviewers.
- Approving the PR indicates acceptance of the ADR, and the status of the ADR should be "Accepted" prior to merging.
- Once the ADR PR is merged, the person who did the merge creates related GitHub issues and puts them the Github project as "new" issues. These issues should have a link back to the ADR file.
