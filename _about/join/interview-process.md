The interview process is where we get to know you and learn more about your skills, experience, and how you approach your work.

## Interviews

The interview process begins with a 30-minute preliminary screening by phone or video call. Plan to talk about your skills and experience, what you're passionate about, and the work we do here.

If we'd like to chat with you more, we'll ask you to come in to one of our office locations or join us somewhere on the internet for a couple of longer conversations.

## After interviews

After the 18F [interview phase]({{ site.baseurl }}/interview-process/), your point of contact on the 18F Talent Team will ask you for three professional references (names, titles, and email addresses).

Once we hear back from your references, the **GSA Human Resources Team** will ask you for additional documents in order to proceed with the hiring process.

### The offer process

The GSA hiring process includes a tentative offer followed by an official offer. Here's how that works:

1. A GSA HR specialist calls you with a tentative offer, including salary. "Tentative" means it's contingent on [security clearance](#why-security-clearance).
2. If you accept the tentative offer, then we move on to the next steps.
3. You receive a USAccess email to schedule a time to have your fingerprints taken at [one of these locations](http://www.fedidcard.gov/centerlocator.aspx).
4. You schedule and complete your fingerprint scans.
5. You fill out the [e-QIP questionnaire](https://www.opm.gov/investigations/e-qip-application/), which covers seven years of employment and location history, as well as other topics. If you want to prepare by gathering information in advance, the [SF-85p (PDF)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf85p.pdf) includes the same questions, so you can use it to get a head start.
6. After that is processed, you receive an interim security clearance.
6. A GSA HR specialist calls you with a final offer.
7. We work with you to set a start date. Candidates start on the first day of a GSA pay period (every other Monday).

### Why security clearance?

All government positions require some kind of background check. Most roles at 18F require a public trust position clearance, which is more thorough than most private-sector background checks but not as intensive as a higher government security clearance. The clearance process adds some time and forms to the hiring process, but GSA's human resources team will guide you through it.

It can be helpful to start pulling some documents together in advance. The forms you can expect to complete include:

- [OF306 — Declaration for Federal Employment](https://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of0306.pdf)
- [GSA 3665 — Authorization to Obtain Credit Report](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/getFormFormatPortalData.action?mediaId=29769)
