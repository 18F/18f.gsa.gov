18F is an office within the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) (GSA) that collaborates with other agencies to fix technical problems, build products, and improve how government serves the public through technology.

## Our principles

We strive to work in a modern way and use best practices on all our projects. Here's what that means to us:

<div class="icon-list">
  <figure class="icon-list-image">{% include svg/icons/respect-icon.svg %}</figure>
  <div class="icon-list-text">
    <p class="paragraph-bold">Respect for government workers</p>
    <p>Civil servants have tremendous knowledge about what it takes to achieve their agency’s mission. We help clear technical and governmental hurdles to better serve the public.</p>

<div class="icon-list">
  <figure class="icon-list-image">{% include svg/icons/user-centered-icon.svg %}</figure>
  <div class="icon-list-text">
    <p class="paragraph-bold">Human-centered design</p>
    <p>We listen to real users to understand their needs and build things that will be useful to them — without sacrificing technical or regulatory requirements.</p>
  </div>

<div class="icon-list">
  <figure class="icon-list-image">{% include svg/icons/agile-icon.svg %}</figure>
  <div class="icon-list-text">
    <p class="paragraph-bold">Agile methods</p>
    <p>We help you move faster and adopt new approaches that reduce risk on your projects. We pay careful attention to what succeeds, and use metrics and feedback to inform what we build.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="icon-list">
  <figure class="icon-list-image">{% include svg/icons/open-icon.svg %}</figure>
  <div class="icon-list-text">
    <p class="paragraph-bold">Open technology</p>
    <p>Our projects are designed and built in public. That means open source, open data, and open APIs. Working transparently helps us develop faster, make better decisions, provide code for many others to reuse, and keep costs low.</p>

## History and funding

In March 2014, a group of [Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/) started 18F to extend their efforts to improve and modernize government technology.

In 2016, 18F became part of the [Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/tts) (TTS), which also includes the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, the Office of Acquisitions, and the [Office of Products and Programs](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/124174). Like GSA's other services (the Federal Acquisition Service and the Public Building Service), TTS provides tools, services, and resources to help other agencies serve the public.

**What does 18F mean?**

Our name is short for the address of the GSA building where we're headquartered in Washington, DC: 1800 F Street.

### Funding and agreements

We are cost-recoverable, which means we don't receive appropriated funds from Congress and must charge partner agencies for our work. There are two authorities we use to recover costs:

- Acquisition Services Fund (ASF) reimbursement authority: for work related to acquisitions
- [Economy Act (PDF)](http://www.gc.noaa.gov/documents/mou-economyact.pdf) reimbursement authority: for projects that cannot use ASF reimbursement authority

We use [Interagency Agreements](https://pages.18f.gov/iaa-forms/) (IAAs) to set up the terms of our projects, and bill partners through [Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsservices/gov/acctg/ipac/ipac_home.htm) (IPAC) on a monthly basis.
