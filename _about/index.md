## History

In March 2014, a group of [Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/) started 18F to extend their efforts to improve and modernize government technology.

In 2016, 18F became part of the [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/tts) (TTS), which also includes the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, the Office of Acquisitions, the [Office of Products and Programs](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/124174), and the [IT Modernization Centers of Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/). 

In 2017, TTS became part of GSA's existing [Federal Acquisition Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service).

## What does 18F mean?

Our name is short for the address of GSA headquarters in Washington, DC: 1800 F Street.

## Funding and agreements

We are cost-recoverable, which means we don't receive appropriated funds from Congress and must charge partner agencies for our work. There are two authorities we use to recover costs:

- Acquisition Services Fund (ASF) reimbursement authority: for work related to acquisitions
- [Economy Act (PDF)](http://www.gc.noaa.gov/documents/mou-economyact.pdf) reimbursement authority: for projects that cannot use ASF reimbursement authority

We use Interagency Agreements (IAAs) to set up the terms of our projects, and bill partners through [Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsservices/gov/acctg/ipac/ipac_home.htm) (IPAC) on a monthly basis.
