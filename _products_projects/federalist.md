_There’s no easier way to build, launch, and manage government sites_.

Federalist is a publishing platform for modern government websites. In a matter of hours, you can publish a site that’s 21st Century IDEA Act and 508-compliant, has been given an Authority to Operate (ATO), and hosted on secure, FedRAMP-authorized infrastructure in the cloud.

### Manage your design, content, and data in one place

Federalist can get you started quickly and as your needs change, Federalist can grow with you. When you get started, you will have a modern design that includes a blog, customizable pages, a search interface, built-in site analytics, and the ability to host and view data visualizations on a single platform. 

- **Move to production quickly** - Every template is easy to use and built to U.S. Web Design System standards, letting you focus on your content without the need for change orders or inflexible content management systems. 

- **Rely on top-notch security** - Federalist has its own ATO, so you don’t need to procure one yourself. Federalist is hosted on cloud.gov, a platform with security and compliance verified by the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board. By inheriting our security controls, your agency can focus on content instead of compliance.

- **Connect to databases with an API** - If you need dynamic content on your website, you can connect Federalist to cloud.gov’s flexible storage via an API.


As one user said of moving their site to Federalist, "Wow. That worked remarkably well. It’s magical."
