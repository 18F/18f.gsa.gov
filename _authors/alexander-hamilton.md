  Alexander specializes in shepherding complex and controversial government projects from ideation to delivery. A law school graduate and father of eight, the ten-dollar founding father is a seasoned civil servant with extensive experience with the Department of the Treasury and the Coast Guard.

  18F Executive Director Aaron Snow expressed pride at having Alexander join the team despite the unfortunate result the last time Alexander worked with an Aaron.

  Due to other commitments, Alexander will be working for the team only on April 1st. If you'd like to join Alex (and not just for April 1) you can <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/">see all of our openings and learn more about working at 18F</a>.)
