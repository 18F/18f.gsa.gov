### Custom tags

#### authored_posts: This tag will return a list of authors based on a pages' list of authors, as specified in the frontmatter.

This tag accepts an option, `heading` that sets a heading tag above the list of authors. If there is no heading tag specified, the tag defaults to an h2 tag.

Usage:

```liquid
{% authored_posts heading=h2 %}
```

### Filters

#### team_photo: accepts the author's name as the first argument. Lives in [team.rb](team.rb)

Example usage:

```liquid
{{ 'brian' | team_photo }}
```

Yields:

```html
<img class="img-circle team-img bio-clip" src="/assets/img/team/brian.jpg" alt="18F team member Brian Hedberg">
```

#### lookup: that takes an author slug as `input` and extracts from the dataset in the first arg the value of the key in the second arg for `input`. Lives in [author.rb](author.rb)

Takes two arguments, `input` and `args`

```ruby
lookup(input, args)
```

Example usage:

```liquid
  {{ "boone" | lookup:"authors, full_name" }}
```

#### team_link: will look for an entry in the authors data file named "boone" and return a link labeled Greg Boone and linked to his author page. Lives in [author.rb](author.rb)


#### embed: Creates an iframe with the specified link. Lives in [embed.rb](embed.rb)

Example usage:

```liquid
  {{ "https://youtube-nocookie.com/blahblahblah/" | embed: "some title" }}
```

Returns:

```<div class='embed-container'>
  <iframe src='https://youtube-nocookie.com/blahblahblah/'
          title='some title'
          width='560'
          height='315'
          frameborder='0'
          allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>```

#### match_posts: finds posts that match a pages' property. If the property is not specified, it defaults to `tags`

Example:
```
{{ page | match_posts }}
```

Example matching authors
```
{{ page | match_posts: 'authors' }}
```

Will look for all the posts on the entire site and return a list of posts that have any properties
that matches the list defined in a given project's frontmatter

### Markdown rendering

#### [markdown.rb](markdown.rb)

This file allows us to use markdown syntax highlighting within a Markdown Block.

Example usage:

```markdown
```markdown
  ### Example header
```
```

#### [redcarpet.rb](redcarpet.rb)

Our primary markdown rendering engine is redcarpet. This file merges the redcarpet extensions as specified in the `_config.yml` file on the root of the site directory with overrides to different block level markdown renderings.

For example, we have specified a new version of how to render headers. This allows us to take headings

```markdown
  ### Some example header
```

Automatically returns the following, via the `header(title, level)` method:

```html
  <h3 id="some-example-header">Some example header</h3>
```

And it is smart, so that duplicate headers will be given separate IDs, for accessibility purposes.


```markdown
  ### Same header
  ### Same header
```

Returns:

```html
  <h3 id="same-header">Same header</h3>
  <h3 id="same-header_1">Same header</h3>
```
