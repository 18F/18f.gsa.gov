    quote: "18F helped accelerate modernization of waterdata.usgs.gov, which has been serving real-time water data since 1995! The techniques we learned from 18F have become embedded in our software development approach. When we first started working with 18F, I didn’t realize how profound the impact would be on our team... We’ve embedded these methods into our software development to reduce the risk of IT investment and learn more about users and technology.",
