### Vulnerability disclosure policy

The 18F Vulnerability Disclosure Policy was removed as it has been replaced by the [General Services 
Administration (GSA) Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://www.gsa.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy).

If you have questions about that policy, please reach out to the team at [gsa-vulnerability-reports@gsa.gov](mailto:gsa-vulnerability-reports@gsa.gov).
