The General Services Administration (GSA) is known for managing federal real estate and leveraging the government’s buying power to get the best deal for taxpayers, but it also drives and leads technology and innovation within the federal government. The Technology Transformation Service (TTS) builds, buys, and shares tech to help federal agencies achieve their mission. They create better services for citizens everyday. TTS works closely with the Federal Acquisition Service and the GSA Chief Information Officer to be first movers in and apply agile technology in a meaningful way, absorbing the first-mover risk for our federal agency partners.

On September 8, GSA is hosting its very first Technology Industry Day. [Sign up](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/gsa-technology-industry-day-registration-27199447279) to hear about how GSA is transforming technology in the federal government, see demos of products and solutions developed by TTS and, last but not least, provide feedback on how we can better engage industry. Registration will close on September 6. Below are a few projects we will feature:

**Agile BPA**

- The [Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement](https://pages.18f.gov/ads-bpa/buyers/) allows innovation in procurement, lessens the burden on industry and solves problems in a user-centered approach. A great example is the work with the FedRAMP program management office at GSA, the first client to use the Agile BPA. We helped the FedRAMP office hire an agile vendor to implement human-centered design and build a public-facing dashboard about cloud authorizations.

**Micro-purchasing**

- [Micro-purchasing](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/insights) is a process is where the federal government makes small procurements to directly buy products and services, as long as the price does not exceed $3,500. Currently, we’re using that process to buy small pieces of open source software and design through the [Micro-purchase Marketplace](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/). This process has allowed clients to add valuable features to their products through quick, inexpensive purchases.

**cloud.gov**

- [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) is a shared platform built for government that allows agencies to securely deploy systems to the cloud. It takes care of baseline security and scalability concerns and allows federal teams to focus on delivering quality products. We [expect]({{ "/2016/07/18/cloud-gov-full-steam-ahead-fedramp-assessment-process/" | url }}) cloud.gov to receive FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board Provisional Authority to Operate in November.

**DATA Act**

- The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) is a law that, once implemented, will make it easier to understand how the federal government spends money. [18F has been working with the Department of the Treasury]({{ "/2015/06/09/data-act-data-act-explainer/" | url }}) to successfully implement the law.


**California Child Welfare System**

- Last year, California began a process to replace their child welfare services case management system. Through a partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services, 18F was able to work on behalf of HHS with California’s Department of Social Services and Office of Systems Integration and Code for America to simplify the contracting documents and to incorporate modular contracting, agile development, user-centered design, and open source practices into their project.
