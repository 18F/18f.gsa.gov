Accessibility is a crucial part of government product design. First,
[it's the law](https://www.access-board.gov/the-board/laws/rehabilitation-act-of-1973#508).
Federal agencies face legal consequences when they don’t meet
accessibility requirements. Second, it affects us all. Whether you have
a motor disability, you sprained your wrist playing dodgeball, you need
a building to have a ramp for your wheelchair or stroller, or you
literally just have your hands full, we all find ourselves unable to do
certain things at different points in our lives. Accessible products are
better products for everyone.

But accessibility is hard: It comes across as a set of complex rules
that are hard to follow. Not everyone feels confident that they’re doing
it right. It’s difficult to prioritize alongside other work and project
needs. How do you make sure you’re building products that are accessible
and inclusive?

The Accessibility Guild in the Technology Transformation Services (TTS)
at the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) set out to understand
how people in different roles practice accessibility. We asked
designers, developers, and product managers across our organization to
share their accessibility practices, from self-testing to asking for
help. We heard about the barriers that can stand in the way of making
products more accessible, from lack of knowledge to lack of buy-in.

We distilled what we learned into a [quick-start guide for embedding
accessibility and inclusive design](https://accessibility.digital.gov/)
into a team's workflow.

Each person on a team, whether you’re a manager, designer, or developer,
has a role to play. Your responsibilities are different depending on
your role. So that’s how we structured the guide, with a separate
section for each of five roles:

-   Product management
-   Content design
-   UX design
-   Visual design
-   Front-end development

This guide provides:

-   An overview of how each role can contribute to a product’s accessibility
-   A framework for thinking about accessibility and inclusive design in your role
-   An understanding of the human need behind accessibility practices, introduced with clear questions and [personas](https://digital.gov/2015/04/06/using-personas-to-better-understand-customers-usa-gov-case-study.md/) that describe people who would experience particular accessibility issues

We’ve shared the guide with accessibility practitioners across
government, and we’ve incorporated their feedback.

We all have a part to play in building accessible products. We hope this
guide can help you understand your role.

us know if it’s helpful and how we can improve.

*This DigitalGov Guide is maintained by the Accessibility Guild in TTS
at GSA. In the government, accessibility isn’t a nice-to-have, [it’s
the
law](https://www.access-board.gov/the-board/laws/rehabilitation-act-of-1973#508).
Find out more about [Section
508](https://section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies) of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a law that requires all information and
communications technology released by the government to be accessible to
anybody with a disability. Learn about the [Section 508
Refresh](https://digital.gov/2018/01/30/updated-it-accessibility-standards/)
that went into effect in January 2018.*
