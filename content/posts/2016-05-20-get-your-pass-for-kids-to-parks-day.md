May 21 is Kids to Parks Day, an effort to encourage kids to explore
nature, learn, and play.

You might be wondering what a tech team like ours has to do with the
outdoors. But [designing and
developing]({{ "/2015/09/03/every-kid-in-a-park/" | url }}) the
Every Kid in a Park website allowed us to blend modern technology with
ancient forests and historic sites.

And we’re thrilled to have an excuse to promote that program again.

Just like Kids to Parks Day, the Every Kid in a Park program and website
share one goal: to get families outside, exploring natural wonders and
historic sites.
