_A shared login platform creates easier and more secure
transactions for the public_

Last week, GSA launched a new, permanent home for 18F — the [Technology
Transformation Service](http://gsa.gov/tts), whose mission is to
improve the public’s experience with the American government by helping
federal agencies build, buy, and share technology. One of the new
organization’s first undertakings is to tackle the inconsistent,
difficult experience that the public has logging in and proving their
identity when interacting with the government online. Spearheaded by
18F, this effort to create a seamless, secure, and user-friendly “lock”
to the government’s digital services is the critical next step in the
government’s movement to go digital.

To that end, 18F is working iteratively with a team of technologists
from across the government to build a platform for users who need to log
in to government services. We’re also coordinating with the Federal
Acquisition Service, the Office of Management and Budget, and the
National Institute of Standards and Technology on the specifics of the
platform. This platform is part of a government-wide initiative stemming
from a White House plan to improve the public’s online safety and
security.

There are many important services people want the federal government to
provide online — from accessing Social Security benefits to working
through the immigration process. Every consumer-facing service the
government offers will benefit from this platform, enhancing the privacy
and security of online interactions for the public and for agencies.

In addition to making logging in to government sites easier, the public
will also benefit from a more streamlined and efficient interaction with
the federal government in general. This system is designed to be your
one account for government, giving you control over how you want to
interact with agencies, and breaking down critical barriers between
participating agencies, if you so choose. The end goal is a drastic
reduction in both the time it takes to accomplish certain tasks and a
significant reduction in the amount of paperwork or forms that need to
be submitted. Our early research shows that this will enhance access for
all parts of the American public — from the elderly and disabled who may
not be able to leave their residence, to all types of people with
limited access to transportation or technology.

Because we want to build what people need while also increasing the
public’s confidence in the government, this new platform will focus on
creating a user experience that is painless and intuitive, thus lowering
any barriers to entry for people who depend on access to their online
information without compromising security. Further, this project builds
off of the hard work that was already done to create and implement
connect.gov, a project with similar goals. The groundwork laid by the
connect.gov pilot will help us ensure that this product can be adopted
successfully by a number of agencies across government.

To build this login platform, we’re using modern, user-friendly, strong
authentication and effective identity proofing technology. This new
platform will leverage the extensive lessons we’ve gained from agency
efforts in the past, including lessons learned from our counterparts in
the UK who built GOV.UK Verify. More specifically, we will accomplish
our goals by:

-   Creating a simple, elegant way for the public to verify their identity, log in to federal government websites, and, if necessary, recover their account
-   Building experiences, processes, and infrastructure that will use the latest available technology to safeguard all user data
-   Delivering software that will allow government developers to integrate it within hours rather than weeks
-   Leveraging private sector innovation and capabilities wherever possible
-   Preserving privacy by mitigating privacy risks and adhering to all federal privacy guidelines

President Obama’s [Cybersecurity National Action
Plan](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/fact-sheet-cybersecurity-national-action-plan)
calls for, among other things, an initiative to empower Americans to
secure their online accounts by shifting from just passwords to
easy-to-use multi-factor authentication so they can further safeguard
their personal data in online transactions. This new platform directly
aligns with these critical cybersecurity priorities.

These are critically important goals, and we’re blending a top-notch
team of technologists from across the country to deliver this platform
using agile development and user-centered design. We’re looking at each
and every technology component and deciding what to build, what to buy,
and what to leverage from the open source community based on what’s
going to give us the best possible outcome for the public.

### What’s next

We’ll regularly share our progress with the public and the industry
community through our blog and other channels. We will be looking for
feedback to ensure we capture and incorporate the best ideas to deliver
the best solution.

If you’re interested in helping us deliver this platform for millions of
Americans, we would love to talk to you! Please look for our upcoming
communications for ways you can engage with us.
