Need to put a form on a government website? Don’t want to do all the
paperwork to buy an expensive CMS? Consider Federalist! If your federal
agency is looking to post forms to your static pages, there’s a new
resource to help you. Federalist recently published a new resource
geared to help first time users add forms to Federalist sites. After
reading the [Federalist form page](https://federalist.18f.gov/documentation/forms/), you’ll be able
to figure out which federal requirements apply to your situation, and
how to get started. While these instructions are tailored for Federalist
users beginning to work with forms, they cover relevant information for
anyone building government static sites with forms.

This resource is the result of a recent pilot research project to
understand needs for static forms across government, which was supported
by [GSA's 10x program](https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/10x/) for
technology-focused ideas from federal employees. Our research identified
a number of federal requirements that may come into play depending on
your particular situation. We found there wasn’t one place where all
these important requirements were explained and cobbling together this
information from several sources is especially daunting for first time
form users. To make forms and static sites more approachable to the
broader federal community, we created this Federalist resource. The
resource is a living document that will continually be updated by the
Federalist team.

Federalist pages are static websites. This means that while you can add a form to your site, there is no mechanism to handle the form submission to store and see the results. You’ll need to use a separate form service to use a digital form on your agency’s site.

So hop on over to the new [Federalist form page](https://federalist.18f.gov/documentation/forms/) to check it out.
