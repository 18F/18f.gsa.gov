This is the second in a two-part series exploring the basics of running
a remote moderated usability test. In [part one](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/11/14/introduction-to-remote-moderated-usability-testing-part-1/), we explored
usability testing at a high level: what it is and why it’s important. In
this post we’ll review a five-step process for conducting your first
round of tests:

1.  Choosing what to test
2.  Planning for research
3.  Recruiting users and informing their consent
4.  Running the sessions (we recommend three sessions at 45 minutes each)
5.  Discussing and sharing the results

This process roughly approximates how 18F routinely conducts usability
tests in close collaboration with our agency partners.

## Step 1: Choose what to test

The rule of thumb is to test earlier than you think; it’s better to test
a sketch, wireframe, or prototype with one person early than to evaluate
your production website with 20 people. As designer Erika Hall says “The
most expensive [usability testing] of all is the kind your customers
do for you after launch by way of customer service.”

If you’re working on a totally brand new design and have nothing to
share yet, consider testing tools your users might otherwise be familiar
with, like a legacy system or a “competitor’s website” — that is, a
website that’s analogous to the one you might build. All you need is
something that’s shareable that communicates how you want to help users
accomplish their goals.

## Step 2: Plan for research

Planning for research can sometimes feel like a project unto itself, but
it shouldn’t. (For a particularly harrowing story as to why you
shouldn’t over-plan research, see the beginning of [this Medium
post](https://medium.com/plangrid-technology/the-researchers-journey-leveling-up-as-a-user-researcher-a85cd35b53f5).)
The truth is, when it comes to running your very first set of usability
tests, the hardest part is choosing what to test.

Next, you’ll need to work with your team to confirm:

-   The timeline
-   What you hope to learn
-   What you’ll ask participants to do
-   Which of your users should participate
-   Who will moderate
-   Who will observe

Hold a 90-minute planning meeting and invite anyone who has an interest
in what you’re testing (if you don’t know who that is, conduct
[stakeholder
interviews](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/06/20/build-empathy-with-stakeholder-interviews-part-1-preparation/)).
Use your discretion of course, but try and invite at least one person
who has the ability to directly impact the design of the product or
service you’re testing; this might be a program manager, a contracting
officer, or even an agency attorney since government digital services
are often manifestations of agency policies.

At the start of the meeting, remind everyone why you want to run a
usability test (to ensure design quality and better understand user
expectations), and ask the group what they hope to learn: what are the
riskiest [design decisions the group wants
to inform](https://medium.com/mule-design/lets-stop-doing-research-48efcd7118c9)
(more pointedly, what are the riskiest
[assumptions](https://mvpworkshop.co/validate-riskiest-assumption/)
you want to challenge)? Ask the group what user-centered metrics they’ll
use to determine whether or not the concept “passes” the test. For
example, “we expect users to complete their work in under 5 minutes,
with no errors.”

Next, manage the team’s expectations around how long testing will take.
We recommend budgeting two weeks from start to finish for your first
round of tests. Each test itself will take about an hour, and you’ll
only need to do three tests to find things you’ll want to fix. The
“extra time” helps ensure that whomever is leading the research —
presumably you, dear reader — can thoroughly attend to the logistics
that usability testing requires.

Next, identify the *tasks* you’ll use to frame the test. If you’ve
already made [personas](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/personas/),
[journey maps](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/journey-mapping/), or
user stories you’re in luck; these artifacts contain user tasks. If you
haven’t made any of those things, don’t fret. Ask the group to name and
rank “the most essential things that users need to do” (in relation to
what you’ve chosen to test), and then pick the top two or
three.

  <figcaption>An example user story describing an essential task for an immigration officer</figcaption>
</figure>

Next, collaboratively author a brief, believable, relatable *scenario*
for each of your top tasks. The idea is to get your users in the right
headspace during the test. For example, if we were testing GSA’s
intranet we might present participants with the following scenario:

 >*Imagine you’re working on a new web application that will help individual employees at 18F identify and plan to attend conferences together. Someone on your team says that because your application collects personally identifiable information you might need to complete a privacy impact assessment. Using GSA’s intranet, show me how you would identify whether or not your system will require completing a privacy impact assessment.*

Once you’ve got your scenarios, incorporate them into the script you’ll
use to moderate the tests. [Here’s the boilerplate script we use at
18F](https://methods.18f.gov/usability-test-script/) (place the
scenarios under the “tasks” heading).

Next, identify your *participants,* or the users who should participate
in this round of tests. It’s important to identify people who will find
your scenarios believable, but don’t unnecessarily limit yourself to
people you’re already familiar with; recruiting provides an incredible
opportunity to invite diverse feedback and perspectives into the design
process (for example, when was the last time you solicited feedback from
people who use screen readers).

Finally, decide as a group who will moderate and who will observe the
usability tests. Good moderation requires a mix of sociability,
self-awareness, and listening skills. Don’t let just anyone moderate; be
honest about whether or not moderation will be difficult for someone
(for example, the product owner may find this difficult). If it’s the
moderator’s first time, do a
[practice](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/10/23/two-exercises-for-improving-design-research-through-reflective-practice/)
run to ensure the moderator is comfortable taking on this role.

## Step 3: Recruit users and inform their consent

Once you’ve identified who should participate, you’ll need to create
what’s known as a *recruiter* (also known as a screener) to invite those
people’s participation. At its core, a recruiter is simply a
call-to-action for potential research participants. Many recruiters
include a short form to collect information to further filter
participants, but **an email address is all you really need** — which,
if collected on its own, [isn’t subject to
PRA](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/inforeg/SocialMediaGuidance_04072010.pdf).

Meet with your agency privacy office to confirm the language you’ll need
to include on the Privacy Act Statement accompanying your recruiter
([here’s GSA’s Privacy Act Statement for Design Research](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program/privacy-act-statement-for-design-research)),
and to discuss how you’ll store and manage the information you collect.
Once your privacy office gives the okay, share the recruiter on
listservs, social media, or even a popup on your website (which [we prefer](https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/11/08/four-lessons-we-learned-while-building-our-own-design-research-recruiting-tool/)).
For example, a social media-based recruiter could just say

>*“Help us improve the design of OPM.gov! Sign up to participate in a remote usability test by emailing participate-18F@gsa.gov. Learn more about how we’ll protect your information at https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program/privacy-act-statement-for-design-research”*

Give potential participants a couple of days to respond to the
recruiter. In the interim, block off time on the calendars of those who
elected to observe the test. We suggest using 60-minute **appointment
slots** for each 30-to-45-minute test (to account for pre- and
post-interview rituals). Block off three hours for three tests.

  <figcaption>Example calendar block using 30-minute appointment slots</figcaption>
</figure>

Once you’ve heard from potential participants, reply to a handful of
them — one at a time, of course — to more fully explain what
participation will require. Pass along a link to book time on your
calendar, and give each potential participant a day or two to respond.
(If you still have an empty appointment slot after 48 hours, reach out
to another handful of people. Give that group a day or two to respond.
Repeat until you’ve either exhausted your list of potential participants
or filled your three appointment slots.) Here’s an example email:

>Hi there,  
>
>My name’s Andrew. I'm working with OPM to incorporate feedback into our design process. I’m reaching out to confirm your interest in participating in a usability test.  
>
>Do you have any time in the next week to share your thoughts? We'll only need about 45 minutes. During the test, we’ll ask you to share your screen and accomplish some tasks using a design concept. If that works for you, please book an appointment with our team at the following link: [Calendar appointment link]  
>
>Thanks,  
>Andrew  
>
>PS: If you do not wish to participate in this test, please ignore this email. If you do not wish to be contacted for *any* future test related to my work, please reply to this email requesting to be removed from my contact list.

Next, prepare a [participant
agreement](https://methods.18f.gov/participant-agreement/) (GSA
provides research participants with agreements to explain the nature of
its studies and to explain at a high level the privacy implications of
participating in agency-led design research). Whenever a potential
participant makes an appointment, thank them and pass along a copy of
the agreement to begin the informed consent process. Answer any
questions the participant has and collect a signed agreement before
proceeding.

## Step 4: Run the sessions

On the day of the test, pass along to each scheduled participant any
links or files that they will need to participate. This is also a good
time to **reiterate any logistics** that their participation will
require, such as screen sharing: “Here’s a link to the site we’ll ask
you to use later today while sharing your screen:[link]”.

Usability tests often follow key moments: introductions, warm-up,
tasks/scenarios, follow-up, and wrap-up. Give the moderator time to
review the script beforehand (and potentially this [interview checklist](https://methods.18f.gov/interview-checklist/)) and make a
copy of the script for capturing notes during the test. We prefer to
name the copies of our scripts “participant #”, where # is the number
of the session, in an effort to protect participant privacy.

If your observers have access to a collaborative document-editing tool,
invite them to the “participant #” document to take notes during the
session. Observers should keep their notes as verbatim as possible (in
other words, avoid interpreting what people are saying or doing at this
point), and include timestamps every so often to help with analysis
later.

Before the test, confirm that anything you’re testing works as you
expect, and that you’re able to record the test (assuming your
participant consents to recording during the test itself).

During the test, the moderator should verbally confirm with the
participant that it’s okay to record the session (it’s okay if you are
not allowed record, but if that’s the case your observers will need to
take detailed notes), and assure the participant that there are no wrong
answers and that they should to think out loud. Otherwise, the moderator
should follow the script and remain silent. Before the participant
shares their screen, the moderator should remind the participant to hide
any windows they don’t want recorded. If the participant gets frustrated
or asks for help, the moderator should reply “how would you expect this
to work,” or “what would you do if I weren’t here?”

For their part, observers should mute their microphone, pay close
attention to how users are accomplishing tasks (especially along the
user-centered metrics from step two), and optionally contribute to a
[rolling issues log](https://methods.18f.gov/rolling-issues-log/).

Immediately after each session, engage everyone who attended the test —
except the participant, of course — in a post-interview debrief. Here
are the [prompts](https://methods.18f.gov/interview-debrief/) we use.
Get everyone on a call to note what went well and what went poorly, and
to decide if there’s anything that should change before the next test.

## Step 5: Discuss and share the results

Many first-time researchers do not budget enough time to analyze and
synthesize the results of their research. Don’t do this. Plan to spend a
day or two after your research to first emotionally and later
intellectually process what you’ve heard.

Immediately after the tests conclude, pass around to your colleagues,
especially those who weren’t able to join the tests, links to your most
informative recordings with relevant timestamps. This will give your
colleagues a chance to draw their own conclusions *before* the synthesis
meeting, and should help you [get everyone on board with research findings](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/02/06/getting-partners-on-board-with-research-findings/).

Once your colleagues have had a chance to consider the data itself,
schedule **a 90-minute synthesis meeting** to review any/all of the
following:

-   Session highlights, especially

    -   Patterns you saw
    -   Differences between what users say and what they actually did
    -   Workarounds — times users accomplished tasks in unexpected ways
    -   Anything else you noticed

-   Task completion rates, and whether or not users met your success criteria
-   Issues from your rolling issues log
-   Any questions concerning user needs that these tests raised (ending with more well-informed questions is better than ending with user interface tweaks alone; while the latter is valuable in the short term, the former can align your team in solving the difficult problems that will leave users happier in the long run)

Conclude the meeting by determining how the team will use what it
learned in service of future design decisions (as
[usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/reporting-usability-test-results.html)
says “for a usability test to have any value, you must use what you
learn to improve the site”). For example, if your team kept a rolling
issues log, you might conclude the meeting by prioritizing those issues
relative to (1) the business value of tasks they inhibited completion
of, or (2) the frequency with which users encountered them. Once you’ve
prioritized the issues, get them into your [product backlog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_backlog).

After the meeting, you’re done! Write a brief summary documenting what
you did, what you learned, and any decisions your team made. Delete any
recordings from the sessions to further protect the privacy of your
participants (and be sure to ask that anyone you shared recordings with
to do the same).
