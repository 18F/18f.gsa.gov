*The 18F Product Guide*

A product lead can wear many hats over the course of a project. Being a
product lead means dealing with the planning, forecasting, project
management, and production or marketing of a product at all the various
stages of a product’s lifecycle. It also means being a quality champion
and agile coach for the team, inspiring the team to do its best work in
the best environment possible.

To help our product managers, newcomers and veterans alike, wear all
those hats effectively, we’ve developed the [18F Product
Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/product-guide). The guide will help get our team on the
same page and provide a resource to our newcomers. As with all of our
products, this is just the first iteration, and we plan to keep editing
and improving it as we receive feedback from our team and the public. You can provide feedback by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/18F/product-guide/issues/new).
