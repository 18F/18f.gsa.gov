The 90 or so kids who took part in the General Service Administration’s
Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day on April 29 had a really busy
day.

By the time they made their way to 18F for a coding bootcamp, they had
already attended events like making kites with the Art and Architecture
Program within GSA’s Public Building Service, building architectural
models out of Legos, and visiting electric cars from the GSA Fleet.

How could we impress them after that? Turns out, it was kind of hard.

“Coding isn’t a new concept for kids anymore,” said [Elaine
Kamlley]({{ "/author/elaine/" | url }}), a developer at 18F who
helped organize their visit. “Most of them who sat down to code with us
said they played these games in school before.”

Who was more impressed? Their parents, who work at GSA and accompanied
their kids through the 18F space.

“Parents were learning with them,” said Kamlley. “One kid did not get up
from his chair and every time he got a problem right, he did a little
dance in his chair and then his mom would celebrate with him.”

Kamlley used the Hour of Code activities on
[code.org](https://code.org/) to teach both kids and their parents
some coding fundamentals.

“A big highlight for me was seeing two little girls who were pair
programming: one was on the computer and the other would write down the
instructions,” Kamlley said. “They would think through the problem
together.

The two girls later wrote this note:

“Codeing [sic] is fun, but also tricky but we did our best.”

It’s a motto we also ascribe to. Thanks for visiting 18F!
