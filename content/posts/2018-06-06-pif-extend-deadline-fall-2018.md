The federal government needs the technology and leadership skills you’ve
developed in the private sector to modernize the way government meets
its mission. If you’ve ever been interested in civic technology, now is
the time to [apply to join the Presidential Innovation Fellows’ (PIF)
Fall 2018 cohort](https://apply.pif.gov/).

The PIF program has **extended the
application deadline to June 24** to help bring the best outside
technology talent into government. Join entrepreneurs, designers, data
scientists, engineers, developers, and other technologists for a
12-month tour of duty tackling some of our nation’s biggest challenges.

“I joined PIF because I wanted to be around highly talented individuals
who were working on large-scale, cutting-edge, and ambitious projects,”
said Sandeep Burugupalli, an entrepreneur-in-residence and business
strategist at the Texas Medical Center's TMCx accelerator before joining
the program last fall.

“I knew my colleagues had all achieved amazing things in the past and
were accustomed to driving change. Each PIF puts mission before
themselves, and it's been incredible to be a part of a group like that,”
said Burugupalli, who worked as a PIF on a historic effort by the
National Institutes of Health to gather health information from more
than one million people in the U.S.

The PIF program pairs talented problem solvers, thought leaders, and
innovators with top civil servants and change makers working at the
highest levels of the federal government. Fellows in the Fall 2018
cohort will take on projects selected by the PIF program from agencies
all across the government. Some of the prospective roles include chief
data officer at the State Department and chief digital officer for the
U.S. Marines Corps.

Past fellows have worked on a variety of projects including:

-   Modernizing the IRS Form 990 and working to release all the data from electronically filed nonprofit tax returns.
-   Helping Veterans Affairs deliver more veteran-centered services and care.
-   Working with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to help modernize their Heat Safety Tool mobile app, which was designed to help protect outdoor workers and prevent heat illness.

Since 2012, the program has attracted more than 130 top technologists
from around the nation for this prestigious and highly competitive
opportunity. To date, these fellows have joined more than 30 government
agencies for tours of duty.

If you're an entrepreneur, data scientist, designer, or another type of technologist,
**[apply for the Fall 2018 cohort](https://apply.pif.gov/)
by 11:59 p.m. ET on June 24.**
