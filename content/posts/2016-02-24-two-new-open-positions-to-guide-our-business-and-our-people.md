The Talent Team is thrilled to announce the opening of two new
leadership positions here at 18F: Director of Chapters and Director of
Custom Partner Solutions.

Director of Chapters
--------------------

Chapters are 18F’s way of organizing our staff into skill-based groups.
Our five chapters are engineering, design, product, acquisition, and
change strategy. Each chapter is supervised and mentored by a director,
and the Director of Chapters manages this ecosystem, which includes
guiding the directors of each aforementioned chapter.

We’re looking for someone who can simultaneously motivate folks to do
great work and support the strategic needs of 18F, enabling our team to
deliver value to our partners and the public.

The Director of Chapters will oversee about half of 18F’s staff and will
be part of our management team. We’re looking for someone who is
excellent at coordinating large groups, gathering useful feedback, and
fostering individual and organization-wide growth.

Does the prospect of tackling these challenges have you jotting down
questions and dreaming up answers? If so, we’d love to hear from you.
Visit our [joining 18F site](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/) to
learn more about the position, working at 18F in general, and how you
can apply.

Director of Custom Partner Solutions
------------------------------------

Customer Partner Solutions is one of five 18F business units working
with agencies to rapidly deploy tools and services that are easy to use,
cost efficient, and reusable. This business unit is responsible for
products like [Every Kid In A Park](https://www.everykidinapark.gov/)
and [College Scorecard.](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) The Director of Custom
Partner Solutions will work with other federal agencies to
improve their public-facing interactions and drive mission achievement
by identifying problems and making sure 18F can deliver the solutions.

Additionally, the Director of Custom Partner Solutions will lead project
selection and then put together the right teams to tackle these
problems. Alongside all of the work required to deliver reliable,
secure, and easy-to-use software, the director will also ensure we’re
being transparent about our work and constantly improving our methods.

If you’ve got an itch to start leading our amazing designers,
developers, and content experts to make sure we’re building the right
solutions to the right problems, then head over to [our joining 18F
site](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/) to learn more about this
position.

pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, political affiliation,
sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information,
age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental
status, military service, or other non-merit factor. If you have the
skills we need, that’s all that matters.

**We will be accepting applications for both positions until midnight PST
on Sunday, March 21.**
