Ten federal agencies [now have public dashboards and datasets]({{ "/2016/02/18/analytics.usa.gov-agency-specific-dashboards/" | url }}) for their web traffic on analytics.usa.gov. The dashboards show insights into how the public interacts with specific agency websites.

Using the new dashboards, you can discover things like:

-   How many people are viewing the [Constitution or the Declaration of Independence](https://analytics.usa.gov/national-archives-records-administration/) every week. (Turns out, it’s a lot.)
-   [What browsers people use](https://analytics.usa.gov/veterans-affairs/) to access the Department of Veteran Affairs.
-   That NASA [routinely receives](https://analytics.usa.gov/national-aeronautics-space-administration/) over 30 percent of its traffic from international visitors.
-   Most people who visit the Department of Education’s site [head to a page on student aid](https://analytics.usa.gov/education/).
-   Over 500 people [downloaded a trip planner](http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/16Trip_planner_FINAL_web.pdf) to visit Yellowstone National Park.

The data provides a window into how people are interacting with the government and specific agency websites online. In addition to federal agencies, cities and states are [now adapting analytics.usa.gov for their own use]({{ "/2016/01/06/tips-for-adapting-analytics-usa-gov/" | url }}).

The data is also available if you’d like to see trends across operating systems or web browsers, or see what topics people find interesting.
