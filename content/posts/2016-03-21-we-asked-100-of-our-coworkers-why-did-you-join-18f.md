description: "Why did people make the decision to join 18F? We asked people on every team to reflect on why they came here."
---
At the end of last year, we asked everyone at 18F to [reflect on a meaningful project]({{ "/2015/12/23/looking-back-2015-our-own-words/" | url }}) they worked on in 2015. We received dozens of responses, ranging from [working on internal tools]({{ "/2015/12/23/looking-back-2015-our-own-words/#guides-resources-and-tools" | url }}) to almost [doubling our workforce]({{ "/2015/12/23/looking-back-2015-our-own-words/#growing-our-team" | url }}).

To celebrate our second anniversary, we once again reached out to people
across 18F. This time, we were curious about:

-   What led them to 18F
-   [What their pathway into the federal government looked like]({{ "/2016/03/22/what-was-your-path-to-18f/" | url }})
-   What they’ve loved working on so far

We got more than 100 responses, including people from every team and
time zone, and we’re excited to share their responses over the next few
days. Today’s post answers the question: **Why did you join 18F?**

“18F started up during my Code for America fellowship, so I had a chance
to observe what 18F was doing while I was completing my fellowship. It
was a natural progression from using technology to solve local issues to
national issues. I knew that the variety of projects, impact, and people
working here was unparalleled. I could tell the people who worked at 18F
were extremely talented, had a depth of experience, and hearts the size
of Jupiter (as Todd Park likes to say). Designing for the public good
was the only thing that felt worthwhile to me.” - {{ "maya" | team_link}}

		“The answer to why I joined is not actually all that interesting — it's the same reason I've taken almost every job I've had: it seemed like 18F is a bunch of good people focused on problems worth solving.

		​The more interesting question is why — as I approach my two year mark, the average lifespan of most jobs that my demographic and I take — I'm not tempted to leave.

		This is hard work. It is taxing both mentally and emotionally. The problems we are working on are indeed worth solving, and are also momentous, entrenched, and many will outlast our best attempts to solve them. We will at times be completely overwhelmed by the size and complexity of tasks that at first blush seemed simple.

		To me, more interesting than why I came is why I am staying. And I'm staying for essentially one reason: I stay because I feel that I have stumbled on an exceedingly rare thing, a thing that I have experienced precious few times in my life. I have found in 18F a band of colleagues that not only have the ambition to focus on ridiculously hard problems and the gumption to think they can make progress, that recognizes that this work, while serious, needs creativity and creativity eschews prim and proper seriousness. I'm staying because I have found in 18F a nurturing community that celebrates each other's successes, that helps each other up and dusts each other off after our inevitable missteps, that all the while believes not only in the fundamental rightness of our mission, but in each other.

		I'm staying because I have found my people.” - {{ "jeremy" | team_link}}

During my time here, I’ve seen countless colleagues receive encouragement and support to develop their skill set outside of 18F. Coming into 18F, I had spent a lot of time interning in different parts of government, and I was never satisfied with the way they handled technology.

## Product

*Each project at 18F has a product lead whose job is to ensure the project is moving forward. A product lead looks at the whole picture and figures out how to make it work, including making sure we’re user-centered and agile, taking care of billing and logistics, and handling other details so that the rest of the team can do its job. We tend to be generalists, often with skills in code or other disciplines as well as product. More information about our Product team is available in the [18F Product Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/product-guide/index.html)*

		“Our government is on track to become more and more expensive, while the services we deliver to our people become increasingly unusable and unavailable. We’ve seen what happens in the world when governments stop working. If this trend continues, then I think in 5-10 years, my kid won’t have a country to grow up in. 18F is one part of the movement to change that reality.

		Over the past 15 years, technology has advanced: virtualization has made it cheaper to run web applications, and made it easier to design and develop in iterative cycles that respond to what we learn through the process. Our software has become more interdependent as the majority of our people use online services and mobile devices. This creates a challenge of complexity while also providing opportunity to streamline services. The majority of people could help themselves through direct online access to services, 24/7 through their mobile devices and the staff in government offices could focus their efforts on those who actually need additional assistance. We can create dramatically better services at significantly lower lost … with the gap able to be closed by people with skills like mine. It was sacrifice, and at the time appeared to be a career-limiting move, but sometimes you just gotta do the right thing.” - {{ "sarah" | team_link}}

## Strategy

*We help agencies transform into modern, high-functioning organizations through new management models, culture change, modern practices, empowered talent, data access, technology, and collaboration tools. We transform how agencies understand and execute projects: what to build, how to build, and who will build it.*

		“I came to 18F for two reasons. Neither reason was something specifically in my head but once a colleague introduced me to the idea of 18F and I learned about the organization and its mission and work, it quickly became compelling for me. The first part of my 'why' was that it was a chance to help the government build software better in order to deliver services to the country better. It's no secret to anybody in high tech that the government has needed some help in this area for a while, but it's still almost a secret that there is now a way to come and help. And I wanted to come and help. The second reason, for me, was professional. As a professional Agile coach, trainer, and consultant, the U.S. Government represents probably the most challenging customer/client possible. In government, even when there is a desire to change, actually doing so is still a difficult challenge. So I came to the toughest place on earth for plying my trade.

Plus, having worked at very small organizations for most of my career, I was really drawn to the giant well of talent here at 18F, and it's been incredible to work with such a huge variety of ridiculously talented people whom I get to learn from every day.” — {{ "alex-pandel" | team_link }}

## Infrastructure

*The infrastructure team helps 18F navigate the “federal compliance architecture.” This work applies to much more than technology: it applies to our entire operation, including how we work inside the law, how we secure our systems, how we collect data from the public, and how we spend money.*

	   “I joined 18F for a few reasons. First, I’m a big fan of what the UK’s GDS has been doing, and I wanted to be able to contribute to the U.S. government’s move towards building people-centered digital government services. I see that as a vitally important mission, and for selfish reasons 18F was ideal because they have an office in San Francisco, and they are a remote-first team (we use a lot of Slack and Screenhero), which means I can work from home much of the week. Second, I get to use cutting-edge technology. I’ve spent the past month working on the <a href="http://cloud.gov/">cloud.gov</a> team, where we’re building a cloud for government using CloudFoundry and AWS. Recently we’ve been building out monitoring using Riemann, InfluxDB and Grafana, and it’s been fun to get my hands dirty on that.

And there's so much good work to do here: To infuse human centered design across federal government. To make the digital services the people interact with more usable, and useful. To influence experiences that yes, maybe even make the interactions delightful. #AspirationalFTW To paraphrase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvAIvauhQGQ&feature=youtu.be&t=30m3s">President Obama's speech in Selma last year</a>: It's such an honor to be able to work on improving this great nation of ours.” - {{ "kara" | team_link }}

		“I joined 18F to use my professional skills in service of making the world a better place. For a while I wasn’t sure how my background as a software developer and manager could be of use tackling big problems like poverty, climate change, and income inequality. Then I started to hear about the work being done in the U.S. government by people like Megan Smith and DJ Patil, and by USDS and 18F. I quickly realized that this is where I need to be, with these amazing people using technology to help our government realize its mission.” – {{ "holly" | team_link }}

		“I was involved in volunteer-run e-democracy projects in the UK before I moved to San Francisco. I watched many of my old friends & colleagues get the UK's Government Digital Service started from afar, and found it inspiring to see their huge success in transforming government with user experience principles.

		When my second child was born, I got a heavy dose of the American citizen's interaction with contemporary federal bureaucracy, which I think of as "the plastic chair and take-a-number experience". It was doubly frustrating to navigate that while seeing an example, across the Atlantic, of how much better things could be. So when I saw 18F gearing up to apply the same lessons, I jumped aboard. I'm partly driven by the value of making government more accessible to everyone, but even more so, there's the engineer's motivation of seeing something that I know how to fix.” - {{ "yoz" | team_link }}

I also didn’t see a career path that worked for me.
