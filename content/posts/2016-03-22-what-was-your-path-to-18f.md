People come to 18F from many different backgrounds. We've heard from new hires and potential applicants that hearing how people got to 18F is helpful -- particularly for our many employees who didn't come from the tech sector or federal government.

Recently, we asked our team of writers, lawyers, designers, product managers, talent experts, bureaucracy hackers, and developers to tell us what path they took to get to 18F.

Over 100 people from every team (and time zone) responded, and we're excited to share their responses below. You can also see more about [why our team members applied to 18F]({{ "/2016/03/21/we-asked-100-of-our-coworkers-why-did-you-join-18f/" | url }}), and tomorrow you can see what they've loved working on so far.

Want to see your name on this list? You can see open positions and how to apply [on our join page](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/index.html).

# What path did you take to join 18F?

  <blockquote>“My path to 18F involved some serendipity. When I arrived in D.C. a few years ago, I was starting law school and thinking that I would pursue a traditional legal career. But I never stopped thinking like a programmer. Whether I was freelancing for some extra money, writing open source code, or using GitHub Issues to manage my reading assignments, the urge to keep writing software never went away. On a quiet winter afternoon in 2012, I was sitting at my desk for an Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  legal internship and noticed something truly amazing: an FCC GitHub Organization. I asked my supervisor if I could meet whoever it was that was behind this. I met with that person, we talked about how I loved government-y things and could write software. He told me that I would be spending the rest of my internship working in his office. That person turned out to be future-fellow-18Fer Gray Brooks. Until that moment, I had never known that there was any demand for the skills possessed by lawyer-coders. It was truly eye-opening, and it set the stage for me to thrive at 18F a couple years later.” – {{ "alan" | team_link }}</blockquote>

When I saw some of the things 18F (and the U.S. Digital Service, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, etc.) were doing to disrupt the status quo of federal contracting, I wanted to be part of it. Although I'm not a technologist like most of my peers, I feel like I'm helping this cause by helping our team understand some of the cultural fear, uncertainty, and doubt that might block our clients from embracing modern digital practices.” - {{ "randy-hart" | team_link }}

Returned Peace Corps Volunteers have one year of Non Competitive Eligibility, which makes the hiring process in the federal government much easier. I met my now-supervisor at a career fair that the Peace Corps Headquarters holds twice a year. Five months after being evacuated, I was starting in the Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies. I had never heard of OCSIT or 18F before that. I have a few family members working in various parts of the government who have always regaled me with stories of the maddening bureaucracy. It was encouraging to see an entire office dedicated to hacking the government and helping them to work better. I have been working 50 percent of my time with 18F since November 2015 and have found many more qualities (transparency, professional development, empowerment, focus on diversity, etc) that are inspiring and are refreshing for the public sector.” – Rebecca Refoy</blockquote>

## Product

_Each project at 18F has a product lead whose job is to ensure the project is moving forward. A product lead looks at the whole picture and figures out how to make it work, including making sure we're user-centered and agile, taking care of billing and logistics, and handling other details so that the rest of the team can do its job. We tend to be generalists, often with skills in code or other disciplines as well as product.More information about our Product team is available in the [18F Product Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/product-guide/index.html)._

It was the very thing I was looking for: I’d be able to serve and continue to grow my skills in the software industry (at that point I had no exposure to open source).

I started working on Internet startups almost two decades ago and genuinely bought into the notion that network technology would "change the world." But while that can be true, making a genuinely positive impact is not nearly as easy as Silicon Valley promises. As often as not, I found myself working on projects that had little to no social value, and as time wore on and the industry became more and more nakedly interested in money over people, my heart sunk. Fortunately, I was able to jump ship and join the product team at Code for America, a nonprofit dedicated to improving technology for cities, where I once again felt like I was doing work that made a difference.

## Infrastructure

_The infrastructure team helps 18F navigate the "federal compliance architecture." This work applies to much more than technology: it applies to our entire operation, including how we work inside the law, how we secure our systems, how we collect data from the public, and how we spend money._

  “My path to 18F can be traced back to 2012 when I was still at AOL. I was looking to transition from QA to Dev, and thought that a good stepping stone would be to lead the automated testing effort on the mobile team, a role I pursued and obtained.

  A few months later, as part of the team that shipped TechCrunch for iPad, I was invited to attend the last day of TechCrunch Disrupt NYC. Todd Park and Steven VanRoekel happened to be announcing the PIF program that day, and their passionate and spirited talk on innovation in the government blew me away. I started following Todd on Twitter, and that same day, he mentioned Code for America. Shortly thereafter, I found out about the open application for their Fellowship program. I applied because I wanted to give back to the community and make a long-lasting impact while acquiring new skills and being surrounded by smart and talented people who share the same vision and passion for improving society.

  My CfA teammates and I built <a href="http://ohanapi.org">Ohana API</a>, an open source platform that makes it easy for community and human services to be discoverable. We ended up being one of the seven winners of the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201447979>Knight News Challenge for Health</a> in 2014, and got a grant to improve the project for another year.

  In late 2014, I attended a Hack Night for Open Opportunities, where I paired with Sarah Allen to implement a feature, and later submitted <a href="https://github.com/18F/openopps-platform/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amonfresh+is%3Aclosed">these two pull requests</a>.

I moved to China for a year, where I ended up working for a startup as a web developer and began learning about civic tech.

  After moving back to the US, I ended up in New York and discovered the local Code For America brigade. I always thought I wanted to apply my programming ability to problems that served the public.

From there I worked at National Journal (which included helping support the Almanac of American Politics), the Library of Congress (as a contractor), a small startup focused on making healthcare more personal for employees at other companies, and then Bloomberg BNA most recently. Jackie Kazil (a former colleague of mine when we were at the Library of Congress together) was my initial link to 18F.” - {{ "carlo-costino" | team_link }}

  “A former coworker took me to the Personal Democracy Forum conference. Erie Meyer from USDS was on a panel, and she asked a room full of open government advocates "who here has actually worked in public sector?" Only a few raised their hands. She then challenged the group to actually get jobs in government and create the transparency they wanted to see. Working in government was not something I had ever considered, so I decided to take her challenge. I heard about 18F shortly after that, and after a couple of conversations, knew it was where I wanted to be.” - {{ "afeld" | team_link }}

<blockquote>“First, the people: 18F (and the sibling organizations like USDS, PIF, etc) have such an amazing staff including a bunch of people I've worked with or want to work with. It's a pretty spectacular team. And, it's by far the most diverse team I've ever worked on, which aligns very closely to my personal politics. It's like a breath of fresh air, looking around the office and not just seeing a bunch of young white dudes.

Second: Open Source: open source -- and in general doing work in the open -- is super-important to me, but has been something I've had a really hard time finding time for at other jobs. 18F's "we work in the open" default means my work should be a lot more aligned with my desire to work on open source at work.” – Jacob Kaplan-Moss</blockquote>

  “My family has a history of serving this country in any way it can. Both of my grandfathers were veterans of the Army, serving in the WWII Pacific theater, and Korea. My brother, brother-in-law, and three cousins have all served their country in the Marine Corps before and after the turmoil of 9/11. I knew I was not the military kind, so I took a different approach to serving, working as a consultant to the government to build better, and more re-usable software. The software market in government is saturated with vendors, both good and bad, and so exposure to being able to drive innovation is limited. I wanted to have a greater impact on how the government builds software, and found that 18F has that same mission.” – {{ "adam-kendall" | team_link }}

  <blockquote>“After years of working in the advertising industry, I wanted a change that would make a real impact in the world using software. Instead of helping people click-through to more content or change an ad-specific communication preference, I want to change the way people have to interact with government services whether it's tools used by federal agencies or by the American people. I am a self-taught software developer that found my place in web development by coming in through the window, specifically the browser window. Coming from a traditional graphic design background, CSS and systems design were two things that felt as natural as color theory and typography.

I first encountered the work of 18F as a senior advisor to the Administrator, then began working closely with 18F when I was deputy CCO with the customer team. Finally, I was working more closely day-to-day with 18F as Chief of Staff for OCSIT/18F. With 18F, I was always impressed with how everyone was here for the right reason (they wanted to push government forward) and there is very little ego/hierarchy -- people just want to get good work done and are pretty flexible with the 'how.'” – Vicki McFadden</blockquote>

  “In 2012, former U.S. CTO Todd Park tweeted he was "looking for a few good women and men to serve their country" as part of a new program called the White House Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIFs). As a member of the first class of fellows, my team worked on reimagining the relationship between the government and the people from a technology perspective. I went back to TurboTax after the fellowship ended, and felt like something was missing. Cut to December 2014, as I watched Todd and the gang talk about the relatively-new government startups called U.S. Digital Services (USDS) and 18F onstage at the Lean Startup Conference in San Francisco. I couldn't stop grinning because: 1. They were remarkable up there; and 2. I realized we PIFs had been human MVPs for this blueprint of bringing outside technologists into federal government. And our little lean experiment was working like gangbusters. One month later I gave notice at work, and joined 18F!” — {{ "kara" | team_link }}
