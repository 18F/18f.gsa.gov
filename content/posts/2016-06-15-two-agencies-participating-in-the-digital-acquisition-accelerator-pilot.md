Today, we’re thrilled to announce that we’ve selected the Federal Bureau
of Investigation and the U.S. Department of the Treasury as the first
agencies to participate in the [Digital Acquisition
Accelerator](https://pages.18f.gov/digitalaccelerator/) pilot.

Over the next six to eight months, teams of individuals at these
agencies will come together to participate in the first cohort of the
pilot where they will receive basic training in human-centered design,
lean-agile methodologies, open innovation, and modular contracting, and
then complete two digital acquisitions using that new-found knowledge
with assistance and coaching from the pilot program team.

[Announced in
March](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/03/09/fostering-culture-innovation-across-government-through-acquisition-innovation-labs),
the pilot was launched in order to help agencies accelerate the adoption
of emerging digital acquisition practices such as lean-agile and
human-centered design. This fully-funded U.S. General Services
Administration project is a joint partnership between 18F and the
Presidential Innovation Fellows. Over the next six to eight months, this
cross-organizational team will help agencies establish their own
internal group of digital acquisition experts by working together on
real-world acquisitions.

These two agencies are the first to participate in the pilot. We’re
planning a second phase that will build upon the lessons we learn from
this first phase.

Each of these agencies have a deep commitment to inspiring change at
their organization, and to pursuing this work after the pilot is
complete. Want to get updates on our progress and learn along with us?
