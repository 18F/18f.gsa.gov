Serving America’s diverse population is central to 18F’s mission. To help us
further this effort, we’ve adopted a new illustration style to capture a broad
spectrum of human experiences.

Previously, we used Pablo Stanley’s <a
href="https://blush.design/collections/rChdrB8vX8xQJunpDPp8/avatars">Avataaars</a>
library to represent people.

While able to depict a range of skin tones and ages, the bust portraits
ultimately proved limiting when trying to represent the vast collective of
human experiences.

Our new image style is based on Pablo Stanley’s open-source library <a
href="https://www.openpeeps.com/">Open Peeps</a>. We call our version, which
reflects the brand’s signature blue tones and flat forms, <em>18F Folks</em>.

Now our graphics look like:

<figure>
{% image "assets/blog/18f-folks/slide0.png" "A presentation slide showcasing a cartoon of a woman in a wheelchair holding a microphone. The text next to her says Hear, hear! We're transitioning to 18F Folks for our illustration style." %}

{% image "assets/blog/18f-folks/slide1.png" "A presentation slide with 3 vignettes of the same male in 18F Folks cartoon style. He progresses in expressions from happy, to confused, to frustrated.  Underneath each of his portrait is text as to questions or blockers he has through a generic user journey." %}
</figure>

With <em>18F Folks</em>, we’re able to construct vignettes of people interacting with
each other and their environments. This helps us narrate stories about the
world we want to build.

As a government agency, we use branding to inform and engage the public.
Relationships emerge from the content we share. For instance, government
agencies have reached out after reading this blog, asking how to emulate
software systems and service processes. Something as basic as our illustration
style impacts how our audience perceives us.

Consider this simple presentation slide.

<figure>

{% image_with_class "assets/blog/18f-folks/slide-confused.png" "border border-base-lighter" "A presentation slide showing a list on the left of common timekeep mistakes. Next to the list is a shrugging woman in the style of 18F Folks cartoon." %}

</figure>

While the content presents a matter-of-fact list, the shrugging Peep conveys
the body language equivalent of “I’m with you. This is confusing.” We opted
for an illustration style that can cue understanding and trust—emotions more
complex than the previous style would allow.

Some organizations may delegate branding directives to a marketing team.  At
18F, we leverage the combined strength of our multifaceted design team to
bring ideas like <em>18F Folks</em> to life. Our content designer took inspiration from
18F’s written tone to inform our selection criteria, emphasizing qualities
like “welcoming” and “conversational.” Service designers conducted research to
determine ideal use cases for illustrations. 

The team then created a scorecard and conducted a comparative analysis of
several illustration libraries. Open Peeps was selected as the basis of the
<em>18F Folks</em> style because it balances professional with approachable.

The left column has criteria such as open source, matches 18F's voice, etc. The following columns determine if different visual libraries meet the criteria.  Green, yellow, and red cells suggest if criteria are met or not." %}

Product managers compiled a list of additional characteristics to make the 18F
Folks library even more inclusive. Considerations included diverse religious
dress, physical abilities, and body types.

We added custom shirts, a hearing aid, as well as a pregnant person and a
child. This is just the start.

</figure>

On the surface, these depictions are simply bubbly cartoon characters. But we
intentionally adopted an illustration style where more people can find
themselves reflected in the content we share. When people can see themselves
in media, they feel seen. That’s why it is so important for us to represent
the diverse American public. We want every person to believe that they matter
to us–that we are a government by the people, for the people. After all, good
branding is the public celebration of a group's shared values.
