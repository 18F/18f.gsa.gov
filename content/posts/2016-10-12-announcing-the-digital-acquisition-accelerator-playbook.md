Built on the lessons learned during the pilot phase of the [Digital Acquisitions Accelerator](https://pages.18f.gov/digitalaccelerator/), the accompanying [playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/digital-acquisition-playbook/) examines the current acquisition landscape and provides an approach to procuring custom software solutions. Our goal is to make the government a smarter and more informed buyer of digital products and services.

The playbook has four main sections:

- Overview
- Case studies
- Process
- Primers

The [overview section](https://pages.18f.gov/digital-acquisition-playbook/) provides background on digital acquisitions and highlights some ways to lower risk when planning this type of activity. The [case study section](https://pages.18f.gov/digital-acquisition-playbook/case-study/) looks to underline successful projects and approaches to digital acquisitions in agencies across the federal government. The [process section](https://pages.18f.gov/digital-acquisition-playbook/process/) details our approach to digital acquisitions from building a cross-functional team to closing out phases of a project (Note: some sections of the handbook are still in-progress). Lastly, the [primers section](https://pages.18f.gov/digital-acquisition-playbook/primers/) provides an overview of key concepts and terms related to digital acquisitions. Currently, the playbook includes primers on agile, lean startup, human-centered design, open innovation, and modular contracting.

There’s a lot to learn about digital acquisitions and more of it’s being defined as we go along. We hope that this [playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/digital-acquisition-playbook/) serves as a “where to start” guide. We also plan to publish more tools, resources, and tactics as we discover them in our day-to-day work at [18F]({{ "/" | url }}), the [Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/) program (PIF), and from the work of our agency partners across the government.

In short, this is a living playbook that should be refined over time based on all of our collective experiences. Since the [playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/digital-acquisition-playbook/) is live on GitHub, you can directly suggest edits or improvements by making a [pull request or filing an issue](https://github.com/18F/digital-acquisition-playbook). Let’s work together to pool our collective knowledge of the digital acquisition landscape into this playbook to make it more useful for everyone.
