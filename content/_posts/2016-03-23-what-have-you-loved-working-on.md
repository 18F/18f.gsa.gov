description: "One of the best parts of working at 18F is the focus on meaningful, mission-driven projects. But which projects? We asked everyone across the organization to tell us what they've most enjoyed working on. Here are their responses."
---

Two weeks ago, we asked everyone across 18F to answer a few simple questions:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/03/21/we-asked-100-of-our-coworkers-why-did-you-join-18f/">Why did you join 18F?</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/03/22/what-was-your-path-to-18f/">What was your path to get here?</a></li>
  <li>And what have you loved working on?</li>
</ul>

Dozens of people from every team and time zone responded, and today we share their answers to the question: What have you loved working on?

Here's the tl;dr: More than one person mentioned that they really enjoyed working on meaningful, mission-driven projects that impact millions of people. It's true: we work on projects like <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/">College Scorecard</a>, a clearinghouse to provide the clearest, most accessible, and reliable national data on college cost, graduation, debt, and post-college earnings, and <a href="https://myaccount.uscis.dhs.gov/">an account system</a> used by hundreds of thousands of immigrants to keep their information up to date.

When we work on big, meaningful projects, we do it in the open — all of <a href="https://github.com/18F/">our code is public</a> and we publish how-tos, tutorials, and what we've learned on the 18F blog.

If this post and these projects appeal to you, you can see our open positions and apply to 18F <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/index.html">on our join page</a>.

## Strategy

_Our strategists help agencies transform into modern, high-functioning organizations through new management models, culture change, modern practices, empowered talent, data access, and collaboration tools._

## Team building

_The Engineering team is composed of smaller teams each organized by a facilitator. While most engineers at 18F will work in cross-functional project teams, their engineering teams will serve as small communities of practice designed to encourage cross-pollination that might not otherwise occur in a large, distributed team._

“I have loved working on both the Team API and its related projects in order to support the tools that help build and propagate 18F’s internal data, and I have loved working with the FEC project team (and the FEC itself!) on the <a href="https://beta.fec.gov/">new FEC web site</a>. It’s been the best of both worlds so far as I’ve been able to dive back into technologies I haven’t worked with in a while, learn a whole host of new things, and engage directly with some of our agency partners. I have also greatly enjoyed participating in our working groups and see them as a conduit for instilling a culture of learning and keeping ourselves apprised of better ways we could approach our work and industry best-practices.” - {{ "carlo-costino" | team_link }}

I loved working with the EITI team, because they’re focused on open data that ties with climate change and larger accountability initiatives within the government. I’ve also enjoyed working on onboarding, because I get to learn about different teams, meet new people as they join 18F, and help improve our internal documentation on a daily basis.” - {{ "nicole-fenton" | team_link }}

## Design Standards

<div class="pquote">{{ "marco" | team_photo }}

“As a front end developer at 18F, I've worked on many different projects. Two highlights are the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/">Draft U.S. Web Design Standards</a>, a visual style guide and UI component library for federal websites, and the <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/frontend/">18F Front End Guild</a>. The Design Standards purpose is to improve design of Federal websites by providing a shared, usable, accessible style that can be installed and configured for different sites. One great thing about the Standards is it attempts to use the top, modern front end practices, so it ends up bringing these best practices to the federal government. Being an example of using good front end practices fits well into the goals of the 18F Front End Guild: a group of developers all interested in improving front end development across 18F. The guild works to set standards, create guides, teach classes, and mentor other developers to make front end development as easy as possible at 18F.” - {{ "marco" | team_link }}

I love working with team members to get their first post up on the site.” - {{ "andre" | team_link }}
