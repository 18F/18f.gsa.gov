Now’s the time to get involved in transforming how the government
builds, buys, and shares technology. Now’s the time to lead a growing
office of talented and motivated people looking to help federal agencies
deliver better services to the public at a lower cost. Sound
interesting? Then we’ve got a job for you: [Commissioner of the
Technology Transformation
Service](https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/444223600/).

The [Technology Transformation
Service](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/05/03/delivering-the-next-generation-of-digital-government/)
(TTS) is a new organization within the General Services Administration
(GSA) that includes 18F, the Presidential Innovation Fellows program,
the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), and the
Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technology.

Together, these offices are working on some of the most critical parts
of the federal government’s online presence and creating the next
generation of policies, tools, and practices to radically improve how
the government does tech. This includes sites like cloud.gov, usa.gov,
gobiernousa.gov, kids.gov, data.gov, challenge.gov, and
analytics.usa.gov.

There’s a lot of exciting work happening across TTS from security to
cloud hosting to open data to user-centered design. We’re looking for
someone to help us increase our impact, while providing the best service
possible to our partners.

Applications are [due to
USAJOBS](https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/444223600/) by August 1, so get yours in soon (or pass this on to someone who you think might
be right for the job.) Find out [more about the
position](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/139026) from GSA.
