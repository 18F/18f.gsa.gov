If you’re looking for a way to have an impact on the digital services
the government provides to the public, now’s your opportunity. The
Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program is [currently accepting
applications](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/) for the
Spring 2017 cohort. Come join other technologists, entrepreneurs, and
innovators for a 12-month stint building and improving vital public
services.

Past fellows have worked on all kinds of incredible projects, including:

-   [code.gov](https://code.gov/), a platform for [government open source code](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/11/07/code-gov-the-next-milestone-federal-open-source-code/) and policies that encourages the reuse of government code
-   The [Digital Acquisition Accelerator](https://pages.18f.gov/digitalaccelerator/), which works with federal agencies to teach them modern digital procurement practices so taxpayers spend less and get better results
-   [trials.cancer.gov](https://trials.cancer.gov), a streamlined, user-friendly site for searching for clinical trials supported by the National Cancer Institute along with a new API that is making it much easier for researchers to recruit new participants and for patients to find trials
-   And much, much more

The PIF program is an instrumental piece of a large and vibrant movement
to bring better services to the public through iterative development,
open source code, and human-centered design. PIFs work all over the
country on a wide range of topics from product to policy.

If you want to spend a year having a positive impact on how the
government serves the public, apply to be a Presidential Innovation
Fellow. Applications for the Spring 2017 cohort are **due by 11:59 p.m.
