In the five months since we launched the [Draft U.S. Web Design
Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards) — the U.S.
government’s very own set of common UI components and visual styles for
websites — over a dozen websites have used components of the Draft
Standards on their sites.

Recently, we talked to three federal web designers about their
experiences using the Draft Standards, which were designed with
accessibility and flexibility in mind:

-   Maria Marrero is the User Experience Designer for [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/).
-   Luke Keller is a Presidential Innovation Fellow and product designer who worked on [vote.usa.gov](https://vote.usa.gov/).
-   Eddie Hunter works on the U.S. Geological Survey’s HazDev web team, which is working on a [web application](https://github.com/usgs/earthquake-eventpages) for displaying earthquakes as well as [a website for the Earthquake Hazards program](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/).

Each site incorporates parts of the Draft Standards in different ways.
We chatted with Maria, Eddie, and Luke about their experiences using the
Draft Standards — and how they would improve them.

## 1. How did you hear about the Draft Standards and how did you integrate them into your sites?

**Maria Marrero:** I first heard about the Draft Standards when this effort was
just an initial idea by the U.S. Digital Service and 18F teams. As a
User Experience Designer for [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/), another
platform managed by the General Services Administration, I found it
incredibly useful and something that is needed across government
websites. The USAGov team then started connecting with the core team of
developers and designers to get this effort kicked off.

[USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/) has adopted the Draft Standards with
some of the forms that are used by our users and agency partners to
order government publications.

**Luke Keller:** The Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIFs) heard about the
Standards through our colleagues at 18F and USDS before they had
launched. Given our tight deadline for launching
[vote.usa.gov](http://vote.usa.gov/) (two weeks), we literally could
not wait for their release so we rolled out a custom Bourbon
installation and integrated components of the Draft Standards manually.

**Eddie Hunter:** The Web Design Standards project was brought to the attention of
the team by our boss who had spotted the effort on Twitter. We had been
iterating our own template with similar design elements and decided to
start incorporating the 18F Draft Standards into what we were
developing.

## 2. What components did you use?

**MM:** So far, we have incorporated form templates on a few of our
promotional pages where users can order government publications online.
We are currently mapping components from the USAGov platform with the
ones included into the draft release of the Standards and will continue
to incorporate them in the future.

**LK:** Our team was very excited about the branding and dropdown
components featured in the Standards. Because of the short runway to
bring [vote.usa.gov](http://vote.usa.gov/) from concept to launch, we
used the Standards' brand components to remove the guesswork from the
design process and expedite our launch. Without these components, I'm
certain we would have launched a much less attractive and user-friendly
[vote.usa.gov](http://vote.usa.gov/).

**EH:** We started by highlighting the visual aspects that we liked in
the 18F design.

We were looking to improve readability on some of our documentation
pages. We felt that the serifed Merriweather font headers worked nicely
to provide a visual break when the body text was styled with Source Sans
Pro.

The 18F form controls provide a flatter and easier-to-read alternative
to our previous controls. The bold red error reporting styles/text work
well for grabbing the user’s attention while validating their inputs. We
like the alert styles, however we made small changes by replacing the
icons used in the alert boxes with icons from [Google’s Material Icon
Font](https://design.google.com/icons/).

We theme our different websites in order to inform users about which
site they are currently on. We used Sass variables to organize the
design elements and style our pages with site specific colors. We
adopted the 18F variables that configure primary and secondary colors.
This helped us simplify our Sass markup by reducing the number of
variables we use.

## 3. Do you have any advice for other federal web administrators who might want to adapt the Draft Standards?

**MM:** As the Draft Standards continue to reach a more mature level, I
would say that planning to implement components that are simple and easy
to integrate first is the best approach. The USAGov team decided to
adopt some of the Standards in incremental phases and based on their
level of complexity. That way, if there are any updates, the effort to
get the latest version would be minimal.

**LK:** I'd recommend familiarizing yourself with thoughtbot's Bourbon
[gem](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon). The Design Standards are
built on top of this highly adaptable gem, so knowing how to use and
extend it's default functionality will help you utilize the full
functionality of the Standards and what's underneath.

**EH:** Although we chose an iterative approach towards adopting these
design standards I would advocate for a more wholesale adoption of the
style guidelines/template. With full integration into the the 18F Web
Design Standards you become a more engaged participant in the
improvement and debugging of the current standards.

## 4. What could 18F do to improve the standards?

**MM:** This effort is an evolving product where updates are constantly
being made, so I think that improving a public maintenance and
communication plan would be helpful for agencies or projects that have
already implemented the Standards and are in need of updated code.

**LK:** I'd like to see the Standards utilize the power of antialiasing
in modern browsers , and to remove the pseudo elements from list items
by default. I've never seen this approach to list items before, so it
would be nice if this treatment was handled through a class, i.e.
usa-list-item.

**EH:** At the USGS we build web pages that will be viewed by many
different users across the world. Serving a diverse population means
making sure that our pages are easily consumable by anyone, anywhere, on
any kind of internet connection. We try very hard to ensure that we
serve only what we need, this means limiting the number of dependencies
that our users are required to download.

We believe the 18F group could improve upon the standards by combining
all images into images sprites, and then define CSS classes to display
each image individually.

It would also be helpful to limit the number of dependencies that are
being used in this project. Even when minified, jQuery is still almost
100KB. That might not sound like a lot, but in many cases that would
double the weight of our pages! We just want to caution against adding
these dependencies when perfectly valid alternatives already exist. In
this case you could just use plain JavaScript to code the components.
(\*We serve a global community, think Haiti and other developing nations
with limited bandwidth who need critical information quickly in order to
save lives. etc...)

A large part of this 18F project is focused on providing a template for
developers to build webpages. While working with this project I was
surprised to find that occasionally items break out of the template and
cause horizontal scrolling on the page. It would be nice if tables were
responsive so that they wouldn't break the page layout on small screens.

## 5. Anything else you'd like to add?

**MM:** The team working on the Standards is doing a great job at
pulling people together from different agencies and projects across
government to get feedback on what is needed for future releases. This
is a good way to engage developers and designers and produce a more
complete product.

Finally, it has been very helpful to have direct access to their GitHub
repository and be able to share ideas or solutions or just learn what
other challenges agencies face. Keep up the good work!

**LK:** PIFs are currently in the process of building four separate
prototypes that all utilize the Standards. We look forward to sharing
our learnings with 18F and the larger community of developers in
government. Thanks for all of your hard work!

**EH:** In an attempt to improve our own visual design we have been
reading Google’s visual style guide,[Material
Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html).
In this document, the Google design team introduces a concept they have
labeled “[Meaningful
Transitions](https://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/meaningful-transitions.html)”.
Meaningful transitions focus on the idea that visual animations are
important pieces of feedback that help the user understand the
environment or interface that they are working with.

Without the animation, the side navigation would appear instantly and
the transition into this new state would not be clear to the user.
Without any animation the user might become confused and wonder whether
or not they are on the same page. Furthermore, the user might not know
how to get back to their previous state (before they clicked the “menu”
button).

In an attempt to improve the Design Standards I would suggest a greater
attention to this idea of meaningful transitions.

-   When accordions expand or collapse, smooth that transition with an animation. Otherwise the content appears and disappears instantly in a jarring fashion.
-   Establish a clear way to close the side-navigation. The side navigation slides into place, can you simply swipe it away with your finger?
-   Give visual clues, add a drop-shadow or shadow-mask to emphasize that the menu is actually on top of the content.

Google’s material design also talks about how, “Objects in material
design possess similar qualities to objects in the physical world.”
Therefore, when the side navigation slides into place, covering the main
content of the page, there should be some sort of visual indication that
the navigation is positioned above the main content on the page. On our
pages, we use a drop shadow to indicate both the visual hierarchy of the
top navigation, but also use a mask to cover the previously viewable
content and highlight the side navigation that has transitioned into
place. That way the new focus clearly becomes the side navigation.
