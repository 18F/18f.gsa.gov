One of the most important rights of American citizens is the right to vote. It is the foundation of our democracy, and in many ways, the basis of our government. This is why the team at USA.gov is excited to announce the launch of vote.USA.gov.

USA.gov is an interagency initiative administered by the Federal Citizen Information Center, a division of the [U.S. General Services Administration's Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729). USA.gov helps connect visitors to important government services and related resources.

The mission of vote.USA.gov is to provide information to potential voters, empowering citizens to take that important step toward registering. Working alongside the [Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/) to create an attractive, easy-to-navigate site, vote.USA.gov provides quick access to 23 states that currently accept online registration. The site also connects citizens to the [National Mail Voter Registration Form](http://www.eac.gov/voter_resources/register_to_vote.aspx), provided by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and accepted by most states.
