  A computer science pioneer, Alan Turing is one of the fathers of computer science. He's on temporary detail to 18F from our friends in the U.K.'s Government Digital Service. Alan says of his current stint in government, "We can see only a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done." We're excited to have him join us for this short engagement, in which he'll be focusing on improving our testing practices.

  Due to other commitments, Mr. Turing will be working for the team only on April 1st. If you'd like to join Alan (and not just for April 1) you can <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/">see all of our openings and learn more about working at 18F</a>.)
