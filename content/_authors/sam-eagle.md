  Our new spokeseagle joined 18F following an accomplished career on stage and screen. Sam has long been an outspoken communicator and patriot and he's eager to represent 18F to the world at large. "This new challenge, computer things, is a great step forward for this proud American eagle," says Sam, adding, "I have long been accustomed to colorful coworkers, with their capers and shenanigans. Here I expect seriousness and purpose.*"

  Due to other commitments, Sam will be working at 18F only on April 1st. If you'd like to join Mr. Eagle (and not just for April 1) you can <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/">see all of our openings and learn more about working at 18F</a>.)

  *As of press time, Sam had not yet been introduced to Slack.
