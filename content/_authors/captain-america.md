  At 18F we welcome all kinds of background experience, and Mr. America (as he prefers to be called) is no exception. With extensive military experience, we imagine he will be able to swoop in and save the day on any number of our current consulting projects with various branches of the military and Department of Defense. Not one to shy from a challenge, he's also interested in putting his experience as a member of the Greatest Generation to use in consulting projects with the Social Security Administration.

  Due to other commitments, Mr. America will be working at 18F only on April 1st. If you'd like to join Mr. America (and not just for April 1) you can <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/">see all of our openings and learn more about working at 18F</a>.)
