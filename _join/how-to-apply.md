When you apply for a role at 18F, you’ll need to submit a [government-style resume](#government-style-resumes), which includes much more detail than a private sector resume.

## Government-style resumes

Government-style resumes include detailed information about every job you've held, your responsibilities, and what you accomplished. Unlike private-sector resumes, government-style resumes are often several pages long.

There are many online guides to building a government-style resume. Here are several resources from other organizations:

- [GoGovernment's Create Your Federal Resume Guide](http://gogovernment.org/how_to_apply/write_your_federal_resume/create_your_resume.php) 
- [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Federal Resume Template](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/WorkingatFDA/UCM279014.pdf)

This guide shows how to format a government-style resume and what information to include:

> **City, state of current residence**  
> **Email address**

## Application collection and review

We collect applications during the period specified by the job posting (usually five days to two weeks). All applications collected within a period are treated as a cohort and evaluated against each other.

Once the application period ends, you can't add to or modify your application — but there is no limit to the number of times you can apply.

In the first step of the application review process, applications are evaluated using a qualification process called [Category Rating](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/#url=Category-Rating). Each application is evaluated against the competencies listed below and categorized as Superior Qualified, Best Qualified, Well Qualified, Qualified, or Not Qualified.

### Application qualification competencies

During the qualification and evaluation process, we assess your application against the following competencies:

- **Analysis and creative problem solving:** Expertise determining user
needs or identifying market opportunities and designing and
deploying solutions.
- **Technology acumen:** Knowledge of standard and emergent web
technologies.
- **Entrepreneurship and product management:** Experience delivering
products or services from concept to market.
- **Approach and methodology:** Expertise applying frameworks that
emphasize delivery, iteration, quantitative and qualitative learnings,
and responsiveness.
- **Empathy and emotional intelligence:** Experience in client-facing
roles, navigating bureaucracy, business development, or delivering
services with a strong user-facing or consumer-oriented element.
- **Tools and execution:** Experience in design, development, and
deployment of solutions leveraging current and emergent
technologies and best practices.

Once all applications within the cohort have been evaluated, they're given to the selection panel, which will review and identify which applicants to interview. We also apply [Veterans' Preference](http://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/vetpref/index.aspx).
