## Eligibility

Any individual who is not currently a GSA employee or contractor and who is a U.S. citizen, a non-citizen national of the U.S., or has been admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence and holds a valid green card is eligible to apply. **You can live anywhere in the United States.**

## 18F is an Equal Opportunity Employer

We’re building a team that looks like the United States, and we don't discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, gender identity or expression, national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information, age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service, or other non-merit factors. If you have the skills we need, that’s all that matters.
