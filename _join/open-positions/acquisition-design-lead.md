We're hiring a Design Lead GS-14 to help us build amazing products for our clients. This page includes key objectives for the role as well as the official job description. The [Duties]({{site.baseurl}}/join/acquisition-design-lead-gs14/#duties) and [Qualifications]({{site.baseurl}}/join/acquisition-technical-lead-gs14/#qualifications) on this page are specific to the GS-14 level position. You can apply at the bottom or learn more about the application process at [Joining 18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/join/#how-to-apply).

**Please note: Innovation Specialist is the official government title for this Design Lead position.**

## Role Summary: 

### Design Lead GS-14
As a member of the Technology Transformation Service’s (TTS) Office of Acquisition (often referred to as the AcqStack team), a User Experience (UX) Design Lead possesses two key qualities: empathy for end users and an unflinching belief that federal procurement can be joyful. The UX Design Lead will foster best practices in user-centered design within AcqStack and across  the federal government through advocacy and coaching.

UX leads in acquisition must be skilled in at least two UX sub-disciplines, but will likely identify most strongly with user research (both field research and usability testing). Other areas of proficiency may include interaction design and visual design.

As a UX design lead, you’ll work as part of a focused, cross-functional team of other digital service specialists with expertise in design, product strategy, technical architecture, software engineering, data science, and procurement. In addition, you will join the broader network of TTS, which includes over 200 digital specialists.

If you believe that the government can — and should — buy digital services with a focus on the user, this is the position for you.

## Key objectives

### Demonstrate excellence in the design research discipline, while grasping the core questions and responsibilities of at least one other UX discipline.
All members of the UX team in AcqStack do research, derive insights, generate concepts, communicate those concepts visually, and work with developers and product managers to build them. No one can be equally expert in everything, but we expect expert skills in **at least one of the following disciplines in addition to user experience research:**
  - **Interaction design:** Define interface logic and behavior, always keeping human behaviors and needs in mind.
  - **Visual design:** Define the graphic treatment of software interface elements.
  - **Information architecture:** Organize and structure complex information to help diverse audiences easily find what they need.

Successful UX design leads:
- Zoom in and out. Generate innovative, high-level product strategies as well as the practical project steps and considerations to get there. Be visionary in objective, but pragmatic in approach.
- Apply tried-and-true design and research methods and innovate confidently.
- Support interdisciplinary decision making by telling compelling stories, drawn from research, that illustrate the pros and cons of various options.
- Doggedly pursue (and push contractors and team members to pursue) continuing engagement with actual users through an array of design research methods, both guerrilla and formal.
- Ensure delivery of whatever’s needed to guide development — this could include wireframes, site maps, flowcharts, storyboards, or interpretive dance.
- Write well. Speak fluently. Draw okay. Create written materials and visual presentations that are accessible to non-experts but that are legally and technically accurate.  
- Incorporate UX into agile development sprints, coordinating with content, development, and product management roles.

### Coach and mentor others in the discipline of UX design. 
UX design leads provide guidance to teams, both agency and contractor, to develop or mature user-centered design practices.

Successful UX design leads:
- Coach and mentor staff from partner agencies in modern user-centered design practices as they plan, buy, design, and build products.
- Provide design oversight and mentorship to UX research and design contractors on AcqStack projects. 
- Ensure that design activities (research, design studios, and more) are a normal part of the project process. 
- Contribute to the development and refinement of the UX practice at AcqStack and within the larger TTS team.
- Share knowledge, techniques, tools, patterns, and expert advice with colleagues, partners, and the public.
- Create — and encourage other folks to find — opportunities for research and exploration among your colleagues.

### Promote user-centered design and research practices among clients and team members.
UX leads are strong advocates for the end user through project oversight and client education. A critical part of the UX design lead role is  galvanizing team members, contractors, clients, and stakeholders to understand and apply user-centered design principles.

Successful UX design leads:
- Advocate for the partner agency’s end users and the agency staff who serve them.
- Help partner agencies procure design support. This includes identifying needed skillsets, helping draft procurement solicitations, and reviewing vendor proposals.
- Advocate effectively for user-centered design at all levels of the client organization, from senior leadership to agency staff. Explain the benefits of involving end users early and often.
- Clearly explain the relationships among design disciplines and how each furthers our mission to other parts of TTS, to the federal government, and to the general public.
- Design and deploy workshops that introduce agency staff to basic user-centered design principles and practices.
- Develop initiatives for the continuous improvement of acquisitions design methods and measurement.
- Find ways to measure and share design successes (such as team health, effectiveness, or client satisfaction).
- Share our work with the public through event speaking, blog posts, and other external activities — and encourage your team to participate.
