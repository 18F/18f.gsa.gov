## Role summary:

### Front end design intern - Web Design Standards

The U.S. Web Design Standards are a library of design guidelines and code to help developers and designers quickly create trustworthy, accessible, and consistent digital government services. This open source project supports more than 100 sites across dozens of agencies, from NASA to the Navy.

We're seeking a code-inclined individual to support the Web Design Standards by maintaining and improving its supporting site generators, templates, integrations, and deployments. This is a great opportunity for someone who wants to get hands-on with design systems, gain experience with modern agile development in cross-functional teams, and work closely with mentors. Along with independent coding, interns will actively participate in collaborative activities such as stand-ups, pairing, and design critiques. While complete mastery of all the skills listed below isn't required, be prepared to provide some code samples. 

#### Skills we're looking for: 

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Git
- Jekyll experience a plus

## How to apply

We encourage you to follow the [step-by-step instructions at the VSFS site](https://vsfs.state.gov/how-to-apply).  

1. Check your eligibility 
2. Go to USAJOBS.gov and search for “VSFS”. If you don’t have a USAJOBS account already, you’ll need to create one. To do that, you will need to type in a basic resume and upload an official or unofficial school transcript. Once you’ve created your account, USAJOBS will load the VSFS application. 
3. Complete the VSFS application. Please remember to: 
	- Select the correct internship code. The code for the front end design internship is GSA-USA-3. The code for the service/visual design internship is GSA-USA-8. 
	- Submit a brief statement of interest. In this statement, explain why you are interested in the internship and what you’d like to learn from it. 
	- Please make sure you include a link to a design portfolio and/or code samples. We cannot accept applications without links to your work. 
4. In early August, members of the 18F design team will review applications and create a shortlist. The internship supervisors will interview applicants on the shortlist. Interviews will use portfolios or code samples to discuss collaboration and problem solving skills. We will notify applicants as soon as we can, likely in in mid-August.
