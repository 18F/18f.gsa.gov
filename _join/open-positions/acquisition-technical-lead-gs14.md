We're hiring a Technical Lead GS-14 to help us build amazing products for our clients. This page includes key objectives for the role as well as the official job description. The [Duties]({{site.baseurl}}/join/acquisition-technical-lead-gs14/#duties) and [Qualifications]({{site.baseurl}}/join/acquisition-technical-lead-gs14/#qualifications) on this page are specific to the GS-xx level position. You can apply at the bottom or learn more about the application process at [Joining 18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/join/#how-to-apply).

**Please note: Innovation Specialist is the official government title for this Technical Lead position.**

## Role Summary: 

### Technical Lead GS-14

As a member of the TTS Office of Acquisition team, a Technical Lead possess three key qualities:
- Strong technical background to tackle engineering problems
- Social skills to face human-factors problems
- The judgment to differentiate between the two

Technical leads are as comfortable tackling engineering problems as they are navigating through human-factors problems. This role may be perfect for you if you can [explain technical design architecture](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/ato/) to technical and less technical folks alike, determine the appropriate technology stack for a [customer agency’s mission-critical project](https://ads.18f.gov/) to ensure we can pair them with the best vendor for the job, and lead organizational strategy and change for [TTS’s own endeavors](https://github.com/18F/) — and can do so simultaneously.

While our core languages are Ruby, Python, and JavaScript, not every agency in the Government shares our technology stack. Because of this, you should have a strong, demonstrable experience with at least one modern programming language. You also should be proficient in web development, relational databases, and using Unix-like operating systems. You should understand engineering best practices such as source control, automated testing, continuous integration and deployment, and peer review. The strongest candidates will have a background working on cross-functional, multidisciplinary teams that work incrementally in a user-focused environment to deliver digital products and services.



## Key Objectives

### Objective #1: You’ll advocate for and ensure that the Government obtains high-quality, well-tested, maintainable code across the entire lifecycle of a project.

- Participate in vendor selection, code review (vendor, team, and peer), architecture discussions, and feature prioritization.
- Contribute to drafting solicitation documentation and project documentation, tests, style fixes, accessibility, performance, security, and more.
- Encourage the practice of and enthusiastically share modern development and engineering methodologies and tools throughout all stages of the project lifecycle.
- Influence project planning and design using usability research, analytics, and other metrics.
- Ensure the delivery of code that’s accessible and easy to deploy, update, and monitor, through use of appropriate tooling early in the project development cycle (or by introducing tooling into an existing project, as needed).
- Take pride of ownership in all projects you work on; leave the partner agency you worked with better off than you found them.



### Objective #2: You’ll positively contribute to the culture and knowledge of the Government by practicing and enthusiastically sharing Agile methodologies throughout all stages of the project lifecycle.
- Work within distributed, multidisciplinary Agile teams by participating in constructive discussions, openly sharing knowledge, and demonstrating value for technical and non-technical contributions.
- Practice the same human-centered design, user testing, feature prioritization, DevOps, and other relevant concepts that we expect vendors to practice.
- Help provide visibility into each project’s progress, communicate blockers and challenges, and ask for help when you need it.
- Demonstrate a strong understanding of the elements of Agile methodology (Scrum, Kanban, and so on).


### Objective #3: You’ll apply technical knowledge, problem-solving analysis, and risk calculation to produce high-quality results, meeting customer expectations and organizational goals.

- Hold yourself, your team, and the vendors you work with accountable for measurable, high-quality, timely, and cost-effective results.
- Demonstrate your credibility in your area of expertise, deliver high-quality work, and accept responsibility for mistakes.
- Meet the needs of internal and external customers.
Make well-informed, effective, and timely decisions.
Identify and analyze problems in a constructive manner.
- Explain technical issues and concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
