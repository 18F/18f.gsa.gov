## Position Summary

18F is looking for talented backend software developers to help us deliver better digital services to the public. As a developer at 18F, you will be a builder, contributor, and a catalyst. With the support of the team, you will solve large complex problems while spreading user-centered, open, and transparent culture. You can be writing code one day, going to meet with members from partner agencies another day, and launching a new product that will impact the lives of Americans across the country the next week. [*18F is an open source team*](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/29/18f-an-open-source-team/), so most of what you work on will be open source.

**This role is perfect for you if you care deeply about building great public-facing digital products and services.** You should be excited to apply your skills, share them with your colleagues, and learn from them in turn.

18F’s core languages are Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Go. You should have experience with at least one of those languages, and should be proficient in web development, relational databases, and using Unix-like operating systems. You should understand engineering best practices such as source control, automated testing, continuous integration and deployment, and peer review. The best candidates will have a background working on cross-functional, multidisciplinary teams that deliver digital products and services in an incremental, user-focused environment.
