1. Check your eligibility 
2. Go to USAJOBS.gov and search for “VSFS”. If you don’t have a USAJOBS account already, you’ll need to create one. To do that, you will need to type in a basic resume and upload an official or unofficial school transcript. Once you’ve created your account, USAJOBS will load the VSFS application. 
3. Complete the VSFS application. Please remember to: 
	- Select the correct internship code. The code for the service/visual design internship is GSA-USA-8. The code for the front end design internship is GSA-USA-3.
	- Submit a brief statement of interest. In this statement, explain why you are interested in the internship and what you’d like to learn from it. 
	- Please make sure you include a link to a design portfolio and/or code samples. We cannot accept applications without links to your work. 
4. In early August, members of the 18F design team will review applications and create a shortlist. The internship supervisors will interview applicants on the shortlist. Interviews will use portfolios or code samples to discuss collaboration and problem solving skills. We will notify applicants as soon as we can, likely in in mid-August.
