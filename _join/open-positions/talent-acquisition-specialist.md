We will use a method called Category Rating to assess your application.  

**Here’s how it will work:**

Your score will be used to place you in one of the 3 categories: Superior, Qualified, or Not Qualified.

If your resume does not support your possession of the competencies listed above, we may lower your score, which could place you in a lower category. 
  
Within each category, veterans will receive selection priority over non-veterans if supported by appropriate documentation.
