You can apply at the bottom or learn more about the application process at [Joining 18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/join/#how-to-apply).

**Please note: Innovation Specialist is the official government title for this Product Manager position.**

## Role Summary: 

### Product Manager GS-15

The 18F Acquisition team is built on the belief that federal procurement can be joyful. We work hand in hand with our government partners to define a compelling product vision and a strategy informed by both organizational goals and end user needs. We support government agencies who plan to work with vendors to fulfill this vision, helping them adapt their approach to contracting and vendor collaboration to support modern, user-centered software development. A crucial part of this work involves coaching our partners in product management best practices so that they can independently manage the product at the conclusion of our engagement.

- Product managers on our team are comfortable working in a consulting capacity as well as running a product directly.
- Product managers on our team are empathetic coaches, mentors, and advocates who help partner agency staff develop the skills to manage their own products.
- Product managers at 18F have auxiliary skills in design, engineering, sales, or marketing, but are strategic product thinkers first and foremost.

As a product manager at 18F Acquisitions, you’ll work as part of a focused, cross-functional team of other digital specialists, with expertise in design, organizational strategy, technical architecture, software engineering, and procurement. In addition, you will join the broader team of the Technology Transformation Service, which includes more than 300 people. If you believe the government can better serve the public through the user-centered design of digital services, we hope you’ll join us.


## Key Objectives

### Objective #1: You’ll help transform the way that government buys digital services. (40%)

In this role, you’ll help agencies adopt a product management mindset — balancing strategy and tactics, prioritizing action over philosophy, creating and testing hypotheses, demonstrating continuous improvement, and learning from failure. You’ll guide partners in articulating their vision and breaking it down into actionable pieces. You’ll help agency partners build self-organizing and cross functional teams, and coach those teams to deliver great digital services and better manage the software teams that build great digital services, too. 

Successful product managers:

- Facilitate partners to articulate a vision and strategy for their digital services.
- Guide partners to identify, scope, and clearly explain modules of work within each product and use that information to assess vendors bidding on the work.
- Help partner agencies to adopt modern software development practices, including user-centered design, iterative development, continuous integration and DevSecOps, and working in the open. 
- Coach agency staff to become effective product managers so that they can take full ownership of their products.
- Are enthusiastic and empathetic teachers and mentors.
- Are willing to take risks and challenge the status quo of federal contracting.


### Objective 2: You’ll model and evangelize product management best practices. (40%)

You’re a skilled product manager who can lead a team to deliver great digital services. You have experience creating a product vision, building a roadmap, managing a backlog, and ultimately shipping software. You’re comfortable defining metrics and tracking performance post-release in order to constantly improve your products. You know how to create alignment and clearly explain the value of your products to stakeholders, partners, and executive sponsors alike. While you may not be building products directly in this role, you’ll use all of your product management skills to empower your partners.

Successful product managers:

- Use their empathy and communication skills to quickly build trust with partners.
- Can create a strong product vision and develop an effective strategy for fulfilling that vision.
- Have a track record of shipping products and use that experience as a teaching tool to help agency staff understand best practices.
- Develop hypotheses, conduct tests on those hypotheses, and use the findings to enhance the procurement of digital services.
- Help partners and their leadership understand the value of product management, user-centered design, continuous integration, and working in the open.
- Support, and sometimes reassure, partners as they tackle challenges and adopt new practices.
- Know how, and when, to escalate issues to agency leadership in order to empower their partners.

### Objective #3: You’ll promote best practices, shared processes, and tools across all TTS product teams. (20%)

As a member of 18F, you’ll also be part of the Technology Transformation Service. You’ll share best practices and tools with your peers across the organization. You’ll collaborate and share insights and opinions with other product managers, contributing to our growing culture of product management. You’ll share lessons learned from your work at 18F with your peers, and leaders, to help guide our approach to digital transformation.

Successful product managers:

- Reinforce TTS’ “the way we work” values (transparency, user-centered design, and so on.)
- Mentor others, give constructive criticism, and improve practices and standards on your teams.
- Explore new tools and methodologies, and share the lessons you learn with other product managers.
- Actively engage with the broader team — take part in cross-project and cross-domain skill- and knowledge-sharing.
- Are eager to learn from and teach your colleagues.
