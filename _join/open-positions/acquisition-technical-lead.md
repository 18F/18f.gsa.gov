## Innovation Specialist - Technical Lead

### Position summary

As a Technology Transformation Service (TTS) Office of Acquisition technical lead, you’ll need to possess excellent judgment, technical skills, and an unflinching belief that federal procurement can not only be efficient, but joyful, too. You will contribute to our team and help our agency partners in three main ways: first, by helping teams (internal and partner agencies) support digital services through their procurement efforts; second, by investigating other agencies’ tools and processes and finding ways to improve both; and third, by working with a cross-functional team to identify, prototype, acquire, and build goods and services for TTS and our partner agencies. Applicants don’t need to have previous federal acquisition experience, but such experience would definitely be helpful for this role. Good humor and empathy are key requirements.

### Key objectives

**Objective \#1: You will help make the government a better customer by providing technical advice related to how we buy and support digital services.**

-   Participate in drafting solicitation documents: Help partner agencies shape their acquisition documents to reflect the leading industry practices in digital-services procurement.

-   Assess the readiness of vendors to meet contract requirements and work in accordance with TTS values and practices.

-   Assist, on behalf of TTS and partner agencies, with the acquisition of digital services during the entire procurement lifecycle. Evaluate COTS solutions to meet client needs. Participate in code review, architecture discussions, and feature prioritization.

-   Work with cross-functional consulting teams within partner agencies to promote software modernization efforts and implementation of agile practices.

-   Diversify the government’s buying options by creating new contract vehicles and establishing vendor marketplaces.

-   Demonstrate a willingness to take risks and challenge the status quo of federal contracting.

**Objective \#2: You will promote the adoption of modern technology practices through research, teaching, coaching, and knowledge sharing, and will contribute high-quality, well-tested, maintainable code using those same practices.**

-   Reinforce TTS’s [“the way we work” values](https://18f.gsa.gov/open-source-policy/) (building in the open, using open source, and so on.)

-   Explore new tools and methodologies, and share the lessons you learn with teammates.

-   Mentor others, give constructive criticism, and improve practices and standards on your teams. Display your eagerness to learn and teach new skills to your TTS, agency, and industry partner colleagues.

-   Actively engage with the team at large — take part in cross-project and cross-domain conversation, skill- and knowledge-sharing, and working groups or guilds.

-   Practice and enthusiastically share agile methodologies throughout all stages of the project lifecycle.

-   Use usability research, analytics, and other metrics to influence project planning and design.

-   Contribute to code, documentation, tests, style fixes, accessibility, performance, security, DevOps, and infrastructure automation etc.

-   Deliver projects that are easy to deploy, update, and monitor by ensuring the tooling for this is present early in the project development cycle.

**Objective \#3: You will act as an agent of culture change.**

-   Participate in or lead (as necessary) an open dialogue with representatives from our partner agencies in implementing modern development standards, including transparency, user-centered design, and agile methodologies. Understand and communicate the "why" of these standards, not just the "what."

-   Demonstrate resilience in the face of bureaucracy. Push back against the things that can be pushed back against and take a longer view for the things that can't.

-   Work with other members of the distributed team to identify and solve complex technical, cultural, and organizational issues.

-   Take pride in your teams. Push yourself and others to constantly be improving in technical ability, process, and knowledge. Contribute to and maintain a positive team culture based on mutual communication, constructive criticism, and knowledge sharing.

-   Work towards constantly improving a culture of openness, transparency, and mutual assistance within the Office of Acquisition, TTS, and the federal government as a whole.

-   Serve as a source of inspiration, embodying an optimistic outlook and bringing a sense of lightheartedness and joy.
