## How to apply

When you apply for a role at 18F, you’ll need to submit a [government-style resume](#government-style-resumes), which includes much more detail than a private sector resume.

### Eligibility

Any individual who is not currently a GSA employee or contractor and who is a U.S. citizen, a non-citizen national of the U.S., or has been admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence and holds a valid green card is eligible to apply. **You can live anywhere in the United States.**

### 18F is an equal opportunity employer

We are building a team that looks like the United States. We don't discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, gender identity or expression, national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information, age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service, or other non-merit factors. If you have the skills we need, that’s all that matters.

### How we collect and review applications

We collect applications during the period specified by the job posting (usually five days to two weeks). All applications collected within a period are treated as a cohort and evaluated against each other.

Once the application period ends, you can't add to or modify your application — but there is no limit to the number of times you can apply.

In the first step of the application review process, applications are evaluated using a qualification process called [Category Rating](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/#url=Category-Rating). Each application is evaluated against specific competencies (you can find these in the position description you're applying for) and categorized as Superior Qualified, Best Qualified, Well Qualified, Qualified, or Not Qualified.

Once all applications within the cohort have been evaluated, they're given to the selection panel, which will review and identify which applicants to interview. We also apply [Veterans' Preference](http://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/vetpref/index.aspx).

## The interview process

The interview process begins with a 30-minute preliminary screening by phone or video call. Plan to talk about your skills and experience, what you're passionate about, and the work we do here.

If we'd like to chat with you more, we'll ask you to come in to one of our office locations or join us somewhere on the internet for a couple of longer conversations.

After interviews, your point of contact on the 18F Talent Team will ask you for three professional references (names, titles, and email addresses).

Once we hear back from your references, the **GSA Human Resources Team** will ask you for additional documents in order to proceed with the hiring process.

## After your interview

The GSA hiring process includes a tentative offer followed by an official offer. Here's how that works:

1. A GSA HR specialist calls you with a tentative offer, including salary. "Tentative" means it's contingent on [security clearance](#security-clearance-documents).
2. If you accept the tentative offer, then we move on to the next steps.
3. You receive a USAccess email to schedule a time to have your fingerprints taken at [one of these locations](http://www.fedidcard.gov/centerlocator.aspx).
4. You schedule and complete your fingerprint scans.
5. You fill out the [e-QIP questionnaire](https://www.opm.gov/investigations/e-qip-application/), which covers seven years of employment and location history, as well as other topics. If you want to prepare by gathering information in advance, the [SF-85p (PDF)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf85p.pdf) includes the same questions, so you can use it to get a head start.
6. After that is processed, you receive an interim security clearance.
6. A GSA HR specialist calls you with a final offer.
7. We work with you to set a start date. Candidates start on the first day of a GSA pay period (every other Monday).

#### Security clearance documents

All government positions require some kind of background check. Most roles at 18F require a public trust position clearance, which is more thorough than most private-sector background checks but not as intensive as a higher government security clearance. The clearance process adds some time and forms to the hiring process, but GSA's human resources team will guide you through it.

It can be helpful to start pulling some documents together in advance. The forms you can expect to complete include:

- [OF306 — Declaration for Federal Employment (PDF)](https://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of0306.pdf)
- [GSA 3665 — Authorization to Obtain Credit Report](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/getFormFormatPortalData.action?mediaId=29769)
- If you want to prepare for the e-QIP by gathering information in advance, the [SF-85p (PDF)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf85p.pdf) includes the same questions, so you can use it to get a head start.

## Government pay grades

18F team members are hired against specific position description, with associated "grade levels." These refer to the federal general schedule, or GS level, at which each position is evaluated and compensated. The qualification requirements for each position and GS level are based on a number of variables, including education, background, accomplishments, and experience.

If you apply for a grade level and are not found qualified, you can reapply at a different grade level. There is no penalty or restriction to reapplying.

#### Understanding grade levels

Federal employees on the general schedule range from GS-1 to GS-15. Find out more about the GS system from the [Office of Personnel Management](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-systems/general-schedule/).

GS grade levels specify a fixed compensation range for a particular position, in particular geographic localities, within the federal government. Understanding the relationship between GS grade level, location, and compensation is important to understanding how pay works at 18F.

Each GS grade level contains a series of 10 steps, and new GS employees are usually hired at step 1 of a GS grade. However, in special circumstances, agencies may authorize a higher step rate for a newly-appointed federal employee based on a [special need of the agency or superior qualifications of the prospective employee](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/superior-qualifications-and-special-needs-pay-setting-authority/).

The annual salary cap for all GS employees is $160,300 per year. You cannot be offered more than this under any circumstance.

**The [GS salary calculator](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2016/general-schedule-gs-salary-calculator/) shows how GS level, step, and locality affect compensation.**

#### What does "not to exceed two years" mean?

Most 18F members are "not to exceed" (NTE) employees. This means you can't work at 18F in the same position description for more than four years total. Both your tentative and final offer letters state that you can work at 18F for two years, but you’re also eligible to extend your term for another two years, provided you meet certain performance criteria. The only reason your position would not be automatically extended is if you failed to adequately perform your job duties.

#### Are there raises or bonuses?

Step increases are the most common kind of raise for GS employees, and the waiting period depends on the step. Steps two, three, and four have a one-year period for step increases. Steps five, six, and seven are two years. Steps eight, nine, and ten are three years. So if you come in at step one, the following year you will be a step two. If you come in at a step six, it will take two years to be a step seven.

Bonuses generally come after the year-end review process in late September. You must be an 18F employee for at least three months to get a performance review. Bonuses are either a small percentage of your annual salary or additional paid time off.

## Benefits and leave

The benefits package for federal employees includes medical, vision, and dental insurance, life insurance, paid leave, and the Thrift Savings Plan (the government version of a 401K) with up to five percent matching. Our telework policy affords increased flexibility, and employees who use public transit to commute may claim commuter benefits.

18F also supports employees’ ongoing professional development by providing training opportunities and encouraging employees to participate in conferences, consortia, and other industry events. 

We have a lot of information about working at 18F in the [18F Handbook](https://handbook.18f.gov/), including:

- [Benefits](https://handbook.18f.gov/benefits/)
- [Leave](https://handbook.18f.gov/benefits/#leave)
- [Leave, telework, and virtual worker policy](https://handbook.18f.gov/leave-telework-and-virtual-worker/)
- [Professional development and training processes](https://handbook.18f.gov/professional-development-and-training/#speaking-at-conferences)


### Government-style resumes

Government-style resumes include detailed information about every job you've held, your responsibilities, and what you accomplished. Unlike private-sector resumes, government-style resumes are often several pages long.

There are many online guides to building a government-style resume. Here are several resources from other organizations:

- [GoGovernment's Create Your Federal Resume Guide](http://gogovernment.org/how_to_apply/write_your_federal_resume/create_your_resume.php)
- [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Federal Resume Template](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/WorkingatFDA/UCM279014.pdf)

This guide shows how to format a government-style resume and what information to include:
