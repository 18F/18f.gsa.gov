## How to apply

To apply to positions at 18F and elsewhere in the Technology
Transformation Services, you’ll need:

-   A [government-style resume](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/hiring-process/#government-style-resumes)
-   A completed application
-   Additional documents if you are claiming veterans preference

You can find links to these documents and more information in individual
job postings.

Most 18F positions are in the Excepted Service and are “not to exceed”
(NTE) positions, which means **they are two-year terms and can be
renewed once, for a total of four years**. To apply for these Excepted
Service positions, you must be a United States citizen or national
(residents of American Samoa and Swains Islands) and you must not be a
current GSA employee or contractor.

See all open positions and full instructions on the [Technology
Transformation Services join page](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/).
