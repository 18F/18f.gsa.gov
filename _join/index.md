## How to apply

When you apply for a role at 18F, you’ll need to submit a [government-style resume](#government-style-resumes), which includes much more detail than a private-sector resume.

### Eligibility

All United States citizens and nationals (residents of American Samoa and Swains Islands) are eligible to apply. **For most of our roles, you can live anywhere in the United States.**

**Most 18F positions are "not to exceed" (NTE) positions, which means they are two-year terms and can be renewed once, for a total of four years.**

### 18F is an equal opportunity employer

We're building a team that reflects the United States. We don't discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, gender identity or expression, national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information, age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service, or other non-merit factors. If you have the skills we need, that’s all that matters.

### How we collect and review applications

We collect applications during the period specified in the job posting (usually five business days). We consider all applications collected within a given period a cohort and evaluate them against each other.

Once the application collection period ends, you can't add to or modify your application.

A panel of subject matter experts will review each application using a qualification process called [Category Rating](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/#url=Category-Rating). Once we've evaluated all applications within the cohort, we send all the applications and evaluation scores to General Services Administration (GSA) Human Resources, our partner in the hiring process, to apply [Veterans' Preference](http://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/vetpref/index.aspx) for candidates who claim it. The top qualified candidates will be contacted to continue on to the interview process.

----

## The interview process

The interview process usually begins with a 30-minute preliminary screening by phone or video call. Plan to talk about your skills and experience and what you're passionate about. We'll also share more about our teams and the work we do here.

If we'd like to chat with you more, we'll invite you to a series of video chats with 18F team members for a couple of longer conversations.

If you're interviewing to join our Engineering team, you can [read more details about the interviews we conduct for prospective engineers]({{ site.baseurl }}/join/eng-interviews/).

If 18F identifies you as a strong match after interviews, your 18F recruiter will reach out to you with next steps.

-----

## After your interviews

The hiring process continues in partnership with GSA HR, our parent federal agency’s human resources office. They're responsible for extending tentative and official final offers. Here's how that works:

1. A GSA HR specialist calls you with a tentative offer, including salary. "Tentative" means the offer is contingent on [security clearance](#security-clearance-documents).
2. If you accept the tentative offer, then we move to the next step.
3. You receive a USAccess email to schedule a time to have your fingerprints taken at [one of these locations](http://www.fedidcard.gov/centerlocator.aspx).
4. You schedule and complete your fingerprint scans.
5. You fill out the [e-QIP questionnaire](https://www.opm.gov/investigations/e-qip-application/), which covers seven years' worth of employment and location history, among other things.
6. Once your e-QIP is processed, you receive an interim security clearance.
6. A GSA HR specialist calls you with a final offer.
7. We work with you to set a start date. Candidates start on the first day of a GSA pay period (every other Monday).

#### Security clearance documents

All government positions require some kind of background check. Most roles at 18F require a public trust position clearance, which is more thorough than most private-sector background checks but not as intensive as a higher government security clearance. The clearance process adds some time and forms to the hiring process, but the GSA Human Resources team will guide you through it.

It can be helpful to start pulling some documents together in advance. The forms you can expect to complete include:

- [OF306 — Declaration for Federal Employment (PDF)](https://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of0306.pdf)
- [GSA 3665 — Authorization to Obtain Credit Report](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/getFormFormatPortalData.action?mediaId=29769)
- If you want to prepare for the e-QIP by gathering information in advance, the [SF-85p (PDF)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf85p.pdf) includes the same questions, so you can use it to get a head start.

## Government pay grades

18F team members are hired for specific position descriptions at a specific grade level from the federal general schedule (GS). The GS system is a pay system for civilian employees in the federal government; evaluation and compensation varies by grade level. The qualification requirements for each position at a specific GS level are based on education, background, accomplishments, and experience. The specific requirements will always be listed in the job posting. Salaries of federal employees are public information, and your salary may become publicly available on sites like [FederalPay.org](https://www.federalpay.org/employees).

#### Understanding grade levels

Federal employees on the general schedule range from GS-1 to GS-15. Find out more about the GS system from the [Office of Personnel Management](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-systems/general-schedule/).

GS grade levels specify a fixed compensation range for a particular position, in particular geographic localities, within the federal government. Understanding the relationship between GS grade level, location, and compensation is important to understanding how pay works at 18F.

Each GS grade level contains a series of 10 steps, and new GS employees are usually hired at step 1 of a GS grade. However, in special circumstances, agencies may authorize a higher step rate for a newly-appointed federal employee based on a [special need of the agency or superior qualifications of the prospective employee](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/superior-qualifications-and-special-needs-pay-setting-authority/).

The annual salary cap for all GS employees is $164,200 per year. You cannot be offered more than this under any circumstance.

**The [GS salary calculator](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2017/general-schedule-gs-salary-calculator/) shows how level, step, and locality affect compensation.**

#### Raises and bonuses

Step increases are the most common kind of raise for GS employees, and the waiting period depends on the step. Steps two, three, and four have a one-year period for step increases. Steps five, six, and seven are two years. Steps eight, nine, and ten are three years. So if you come in at step one, the following year you will be a step two. If you come in at a step six, it will take two years to be a step seven.

Bonuses generally come after the year-end review process in late September, and are awarded based on the results of that review. You must be an 18F employee for at least three months to get a performance review. Bonuses are either a small percentage of your annual salary or additional paid time off.

## Benefits and leave

The benefits package for federal employees includes medical, vision, and dental insurance, life insurance, paid leave, and the Thrift Savings Plan (the government version of a 401K) with up to five percent matching. Our telework policy affords increased flexibility, and employees who use public transit to commute may claim commuter benefits.

18F also supports employees’ ongoing professional development by providing training opportunities and encouraging employees to participate in conferences, consortia, and other industry events.

The [18F Handbook](https://handbook.18f.gov/) has more information about working at 18F, including:

- [Benefits](https://handbook.18f.gov/benefits/)
- [Leave](https://handbook.18f.gov/benefits/#leave)
- [Leave, telework, and virtual worker policy](https://handbook.18f.gov/leave-telework-and-virtual-worker/)
