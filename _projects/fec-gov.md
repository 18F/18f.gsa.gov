## Background

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is the agency responsible for regulating campaign finance activity in federal elections. The data they collect and publish is used by transparency groups and journalists to inform the public about who donates to campaigns and how money is spent around federal elections.

## How 18F has helped

The legacy FEC website, fec.gov, is dense. It holds a tremendous amount of complex campaign finance data, legal resources, and information about the rules on raising and spending money in elections. In addition, the FEC had never worked with user-centered design or agile development methods.

As 18F started talking to stakeholders and users, it became clear that what seemed at first to be a simple redesign of fec.gov was actually a much larger challenge. Not only did we need to make the thing, we had to work with FEC to transform its whole approach to making things.
