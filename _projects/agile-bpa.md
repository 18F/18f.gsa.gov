The federal government spends almost $90 billion dollars per year on information technology. 

Many government technology contracts rely on development and contract management methods that often produce products that are over budget, late, and don’t meet the needs of their customers. Even if an agency wants to find a vendor that uses modern software development methods, it can be hard to know the difference between who claims to and who actually does. 

#### Approach
### Creating a pool of pre-vetted vendors who use agile development methods

18F and the Federal Acquisition Service created a contracting vehicle called the Agile Delivery Services Blanket Purchase Agreement (or Agile BPA), which helps federal agencies find vendors who are ready to work in an agile way, and then helps make those projects successful. We selected 17 vendors that specialize in user-centered design, agile software development, and DevOps to be part of the Agile BPA pool. 

Here’s what the process looks like for procurement officers who want to use the Agile BPA. The 18F team works closely with each agency to: 

- Conduct a scoping workshop with the project’s product owner and stakeholders
- Write a statement of objectives
- Facilitate the approvals process
- Manage the vendor relationship post-award through delivery

We’ve already seen projects that use the Agile BPA include more users in the process and deliver results faster than traditional contracting methods. We’ve even seen interest in this model from other government agencies. The State of California is now developing their own vendor pool based on our Agile BPA.
