There are currently hundreds of applications spread across government sites that require users to log in. Many agencies have built these login systems from scratch with old technology or outdated encryption standards. The result has often been an inconsistent, confusing, or unreliable user experience.

To improve this experience, 18F and the U.S. Digital Service worked together to create login.gov, a single sign-on solution for government websites that enables the public to access services across select agencies with the same username and password.

### Making the platform simple and secure

Two of the core principles for the login.gov team were to make a product that had a user experience on par with top tech industry websites and to focus on privacy and security from the very beginning. The focus on user-centered design means login.gov makes it easy and intuitive for users to choose a username, password, and multifactor authentication. 

On the security side, login.gov guarantees an industry-leading degree of security with privacy and end-to-end encryption as core tenets of the platform. Users own their own data, itâ€™s strongly encrypted, and none of it is shared across agencies unless a user explicitly logs into those agencies. 

By using the login.gov platform, agencies can save time, money, and significant customer support resources they would have devoted to managing their login systems. Those resources can be better spent on their core missions and serving their users.
