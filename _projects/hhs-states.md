Health and Human Services (HHS) is a federal agency, but many crucial HHS programs are administered by states. In turn, states rely on HHS for grants, guidance, and oversight. HHS encourages states to reduce technology risks by offering funding incentives to states who upgrade legacy systems.

But many states don't have experience implementing current best practices in software contracts, particularly while navigating federal and state contracting rules. HHS hired 18F to step in and help states set these projects up for success.

### Agile procurement is a team sport

In our first project, we helped California get on the right path to buying a new system for child welfare case management by helping lead a two-day workshop to break an overwhelming contract into smaller pieces (along with people from Californiaâ€™s Department of Social Services, the Office of Systems Integration, HHS, and Code for America).

As California's child welfare procurement moved forward, HHS asked us to work with other states on similar projects. We also began applying what we'd learned to a new challenge: working with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Systems (also within HHS) to support states who were upgrading Medicaid data systems.
