            Graphic headings can be used a few different ways, depending on what
            your landing page is for. Highlight your values, specific program
            areas, or results.

          <p>
            Keep body text to about 30 words. They can be shorter, but try to be
            somewhat balanced across all four. It creates a clean appearance
            with good spacing.

            In addition to your goal, find out your usersâ€™ goals. What do they
            want to know or do that supports your mission? Use these headings to
            show those.
