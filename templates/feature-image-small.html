{% if image and image_feature_small %}
  {% comment %}
    The blog posts frontmatter has historically had the image paths set
    with an absolute path, by including the leading slash.

    The image shortcode needs the image URL without that slash,
    hence the assign statement here removing the first one.
  {% endcomment %}
  {% assign rel_image_path = image | remove_first: "/" %}
  {% image_with_class rel_image_path "image-feature-small" image_alt %}
{% endif %}
