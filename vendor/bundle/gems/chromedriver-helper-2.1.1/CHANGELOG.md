chromedriver-helper changelog
==========

2.1.0 - 2018-09-18
----------

Enhancement:

* Use the `LATEST_RELEASE` file to determine the newest version, to avoid downloading the experimental versions the Chrome team is posting recently. [#62](https://github.com/flavorjones/chromedriver-helper/issues/62) (Thanks, @ibrahima!)

Bug fix:

* `lib/chromedriver-helper.rb` explicitly requires `chromedriver/helper` to avoid "uninitialized constant Chromedriver" exception when calling `Chromedriver.set_version` in a default-configured Rails app. [#65](https://github.com/flavorjones/chromedriver-helper/issues/65)


2.0.1 - 2018-09-17
----------

Bug fix:

* Explicitly require 'selenium-webdriver' for projects who don't have the default Rails ordering in their Gemfile. [#60](https://github.com/flavorjones/chromedriver-helper/issues/60) (Thanks, @mattbrictson!)


2.0.0 - 2018-09-15
----------

**Backwards-incompatible change:**

The shadow executable `chromedriver` has been renamed to `chromedriver-helper` to work around issues with projects _not_ using the gem on a system on which the gem is installed. See [#57](https://github.com/flavorjones/chromedriver-helper/issues/57) for details.

Many thanks to Mikl√≥s Fazekas (@mfazekas) for both reporting the issue and submitting the fix.
