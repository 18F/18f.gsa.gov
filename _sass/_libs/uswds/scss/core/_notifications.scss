  + "\A 2.7.1:"
  + "\A - We added `not dead` to our autoprefixer settings and now use a "
  + "\A   `.browserslistrc` file for these options."
  + "\A --------------------------------------------------------------------"
  + "\A 2.7.0:"
  + "\A - We added new usa-button-group, usa-card, usa-character-count, and"
  + "\A   usa-combo-box components."
  + "\A - We updated our guidance and code for numeric fields to use `text`"
  + "\A   rather than `number` inputs with an `inputmode` of `numeric`."
  + "\A --------------------------------------------------------------------"
  + "\A 2.6.0:"
  + "\A - We updated the markup of usa-search. Existing markup will still"
  + "\A   work, but we recommend updating to the newest markup."
  + "\A - We updated some color token values and filled out the vivid color"
  + "\A   families. This is not a breaking change, but be aware that there"
  + "\A   may be some subtle changes."
  + "\A --------------------------------------------------------------------"
  + "\A 2.5.1:"
  + "\A - CSSO's forceMediaMerge wasn't exporting media queries in the"
  + "\A   expected order, so we're disabling it for more reliable CSS"
  + "\A   output. We recommend that teams remove any media query sorting"
  + "\A   added with forceMediaMerge."
  + "\A --------------------------------------------------------------------"
  + "\A 2.5.0:"
  + "\A - We updated to Dart Sass for compiling. Consider updating your own"
  + "\A   build process using `uswds-gulp` as a guide."
  + "\A - We upgraded our aXe accessibility testing from 2.6.1 to 3.4.1 and"
  + "\A   improved the accessibility of our markup in the process."
  + "\A   This introduces minor changes to the markup of 5 components and "
  + "\A   our documentation template:"
  + "\A   - banner: is now a <section> instead of a <div> with the ARIA "
  + "\A     label `Official government website`"
  + "\A   - footer: nav includes the ARIA label of `Footer navigation`"
  + "\A   - graphic-list: uses <h2> as a heading default instead of <h3> "
  + "\A   - hero: includes the ARIA label of `Introduction`"
  + "\A   - search: the search form is given the ARIA role of `search`"
  + "\A   - documentation template: includes only the main content in the "
  + "\A     <main> element. The nav is no longer treated as an <aside>."
  + "\A - Now state tokens (like 'warning') can can accept non-token"
  + "\A   colors, just as we introduced for theme colors in 2.4.0."
  + "\A --------------------------------------------------------------------"
  + "\A 2.4.0: If your component settings aren't working as expected, make"
  + "\A sure you're importing the components settings in your Sass entry"
  + "\A point (often styles.scss) with `@import 'uswds-theme-components'`."
  + "\A A bug in 2.0 omitted that import."
  + "\A - We added `$theme-show-notifications: true` to general settings"
  + "\A --------------------------------------------------------------------"
