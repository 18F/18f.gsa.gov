Jennifer is a visual designer at 18F. Based in New York City, she is currently working with the Federal Election Commission to help the agency design a new website that makes campaign finance data more accessible to the public. "It's important to be intentional about why design decisions are made, and what they communicate to the public," she says. "My goal is to create design systems that make government feel more approachable, and show the people what's behind all the big marble buildings and flags."

Jennifer joined 18F after completing a graduate degree in Communications Design at Pratt. She previously worked with the Brooklyn Bail Fund to develop persona-driven narratives, and served as a Design Fellow with the Public Policy Lab, where she used human-centered design to better understand high-needs populations in Louisville, KY jails. She has also worked at an international development consultancy and at a Denver-base branding agency.

"I really enjoy thinking about what a design system communicates, and how that fits into the overall context of what we think government looks like and what government could and should look like," she says. "And I knew two things coming into 18F: that working with the people at 18F would make me a better designer, and that better understanding the challenges of federal government from the inside would make me a more engaged citizen."
