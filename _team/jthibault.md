Jennifer is a visual designer at 18F. Based in New York City, she is currently working with the Federal Election Commission to help the agency design a new website that makes campaign finance data more accessible to the public. "It's important to be intentional about why design decisions are made, and what they communicate to the public," she says. "I want to create design systems that make government feel more approachable and human, and show the people who are behind all the big marble buildings and flags."

Jennifer got her start in commercial branding before bringing the tools of the trade to governments, foundations, international organizations, and nonprofits. “I saw there was a need for designing clear, compelling, and impactful communications that express complex social challenges—I wanted to contribute to that.” 

Before 18F, Jennifer managed the creative team at an international development consultancy, where she helped build a brand identity system for a service that sought citizen feedback on healthcare in rural Nigeria. She also helped the Brooklyn Bail Fund design and launch their first website, driven by stories of people affected by bail, and served as a Design Fellow with the Public Policy Lab, investigating how human-centered design could help better understand high-needs populations in Louisville, KY jails. 

"I really enjoy thinking about what a design system communicates, and how that fits into the overall picture of what we think government looks like and what government could and should look like," she says. "And I knew two things coming into 18F: that working with the people at 18F would make me a better designer, and that better understanding the challenges of federal government from the inside would make me a more engaged citizen."
