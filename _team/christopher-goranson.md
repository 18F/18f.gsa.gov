Chris has worked in the fields of design, public health, academia, government services and planning, and most recently was a Presidential Innovation Fellow working at the U.S. Department of the Interior. Previously Chris was Director of the Parsons Institute for Information Mapping at The New School. While there, his team provided innovative design support for electronic health records at the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs, and supported DARPA’s XDATA program. Other recent efforts include climate visualization initiatives with Parsons School of Design, The New School for Design, Aalborg University, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Previously Chris was the Director of the Geographic Information System (GIS) Center at the NYC Department of Health, and in 2008 completed an National Science Foundation-funded fellowship to compare different disease cluster detection methods at Japan’s National Institute of Public Health.

While working with 18F on the Every Kid in a Park initiative and as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, Chris was impressed by the sheer number of talented individuals working hard to make government better for the American people. He joined 18F Consulting after completing a Presidential Innovation Fellowship at the U.S. Department of the Interior to continue to work he started and build new opportunities to democratize civic involvement in the federal government.

Chris's background is primarily in GIS, data visualization and public health. As a PIF, he worked on initiatives to make data and services about our nation’s public lands and waters more accessible. Ultimately, though, "communicating meaningful information in ways that improve impact and services is pretty important to me."

He sees his role at 18F as providing service and impact wherever and however I can. Sometimes that's by serving as a project manager, other times it's as a subject matter expert. No matter what, "I'll work to fulfill any role if it helps our team provide a better service to the American people."
