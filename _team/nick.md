Nick wears several hats at 18F. In addition to being both a front end and back end programmer, he also ensures everything 18F builds is 508 compliant, meaning the products we release can be used with all types of assistive technologies for people with disabilities. Nick spends a lot of time time thinking of and then coding ways to automate testing for accessibility compliance.

"I hope I can inspire people to think about accessibility as more than just a requirement," he says. "I hope I can make it second nature for people, and I want developers to understand why its important and how to do it correctly."

After studying computer science, management information systems, and film, Nick worked as a QA lead with a focus on 508 compliance. He has also built software and courseware for various government agencies.

He joined 18F because he wanted to have an impact on the way government builds tech. 

"It's one of the most exciting things happening in government tech, and I wanted to be a part of this amazing team," he says.
