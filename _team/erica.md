Erica is a visual and UX designer at 18F, where she works to discover the needs of users and develop, test, and iterate interface designs. She is currently working on one project to help people navigate the immigration application process and another to reduce the burden of making and fulfilling Freedom of Information Act requests.

Erica came to 18F from MIT, where she received a master's degree and researched the use of digital media in K-12 public education to support technological literacies and promote civic engagement. Previously, she was a senior designer at 2x4 in New York City, where she designed and managed interactive projects for cultural sector clients.

Erica joined 18F because she was inspired by the opportunity to join a passionate, skilled cohort working on projects that have huge potential for positive impact. 

"In my experience, interacting with government services often leaves people feeling frustrated and disempowered," she says. "I wanted to design services that inspire trust and confidence and effectively meet the needs of their users, that help set a new standard for government UI design and that light the path for other designers working with similar challenges and constraints."
