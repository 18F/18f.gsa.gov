Sean works at the intersection of policy and technology by helping technologists understand the needs and concerns of the rest of the government and helping the rest of the government understand the types of problems technology can (and cannot) solve. He does most of his work in Python and has extensive experience with Django, elasticsearch, Amazon Web Services, and HTML/CSS.

Sean joined 18F after serving as a Presidential Innovation Fellow at the Food and Drug Administration, where he worked on [openFDA](https://open.fda.gov) and a number of side projects, including [NotAlone.gov](https://notalone.gov). He has also worked on NASA's Open Innovation team, where he created ways for people to build amazing things with NASA data. As part of that job, he helped launch the International Space Apps Challenge, an annual hackathon that now brings over 10,000 people together every year.

Sean says he loves seeing a well-planned series of events fall in to place perfectly and without issue. 

"Being surrounded by brilliant people, all as passionate as I am about helping citizens better interact with their government, is a really fantastic opportunity," he says. "There's a huge diversity of problems for people to tackle, and I love how eager everyone here is to solve them."
