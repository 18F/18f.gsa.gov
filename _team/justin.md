Justin is an experienced technologist who dabbles in information security, software development, and systems engineering. He finds great joy in improving efficiency and reliability via automation, test-driven development, and a data-driven approach.

With a background in basic science, Justin began his government service in 2008 as a developer and systems administrator for UC San Diego. In 2013 he joined the second round of Presidential Innovation Fellows to work on the MyUSA project. In October of that year his fellowship was cut short so he could join the "tech surge" that helped fix the ailing HealthCare.gov. Afterward, he joined 18F to continue working on cutting-edge digital services.

Although he is most at home in the "lab" playing with the latest technology and prototyping new ideas, at 18F he's a jack of all trades â€” spanning roles from DevOps to developer to project manager.
