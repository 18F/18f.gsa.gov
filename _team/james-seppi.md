Prior to joining 18F, James Seppi was the lead developer at the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), which is the state’s geospatial data clearinghouse. Before that, he lived briefly in the Andes of Peru, where he and his wife worked as volunteer consultants on a climate adaptation project for a commonwealth of local communities and Engineers Without Borders. He is one of the co-organizers of MaptimeATX, a beginner-focused mapping meetup in Austin.

James has a bachelor of science degree in computer engineering and bachelor of arts degree in Chinese from the University of Maryland, as well as a master’s in environmental and water resources engineering from the University of Texas. 

“I joined 18F to learn from and work with some of the best and most passionate designers, developers, and managers, who are all working together to better serve the public,” James said. “I believe the government better serves its people by building its internal capabilities and using modern, effective practices, both of which are being demonstrated here at 18F.”

He is primarily a JavaScript developer, on both the back-end and on the client side. 

“From my work with TNRIS and as a graduate research assistant, I also have experience dealing with geospatial data, analysis, and web-based mapping,” he said.

As a software developer at 18F, he said he uses his skills “to build web sites and applications for the people of the United States so that they can better interact with and receive services from their government.”
