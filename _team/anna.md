Anna is an internal project manager on 18F's Product team, where she reviews and creates processes to track 18F Delivery's projects. In her words, "This means I often provide solutions that offer creative and unique perspectives on how to solve problems."

Before 18F, Anna spent the majority of her career at NPR, where she managed projects and relationships for NPR's Programming team. She also became a Certified ScrumMaster in July of 2014 and an official Project Manager for Programming and NPR Music shortly before joining 18F in August 2015. She started her career in fundraising and development at NPR, and holds a BA in Communications with a focus on Media Studies from Allegheny College.

Anna joined 18F because of the way the organization works. "I was particularly drawn to the open and collaborative environment that 18F fosters both with the products we create as well as the general way of thinking and working," she says. "It's a place in the government that cares about transparency in order to make things better."
