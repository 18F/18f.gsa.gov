Anna is a internal project manager on 18F's Delivery team, where she reviews and creates processes to track 18F Delivery's projects. In her words, "This means I often offer solutions that offer creative and unique perspectives as solving problems."

Before 18F, Anna spent the majority of her career at NPR, where she managed relationships and projects for NPR's Programming team. She also became a Certified ScrumMaster in July of 2014 and an official Project Manager for Programming and NPR Music shortly before leaving and joining 18F in August 2015. She started her career working in fundraising and development at NPR, and holds a BA in Communications with a focus on Media Studies from Allegheny College.

Anna joined 18F because of the way the organization works. "I was particularly drawn to the open and collaborative environment that 18F fosters both with the products being created as well as the general way of thinking," she says. "It's a place in the government that cares about transparency in order to make things better."
