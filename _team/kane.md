Kane Baccigalupi started in technology as a designer that taught herself C and several other programming languages. Her studies at Berkeley enabled her to be part of the engineering team that built a human powered vehicle that still holds the men's tandem record. It also lead to working on CERN’s ATLAS detector before returning to software.

She has served intermittently as a consultant and a CTO, with one small stint as the director of a tech bootcamp. As a CTO, she created successful internship and mentorship programs while hiring and nurturing diverse, productive and happy engineering and product teams.

Throughout her career, Kane has become known as a “fixer of software, culture and process,” and she joined the federal workforce to continue working to bring “brownfield projects back to green.” 

On joining 18F, Kane said: “Many recent issues in government have shown how much the government needs a fixer, and I would like to serve my country in that capacity.” She works on our consultant team.

“I love programming for the browser and for the server. I am a testing and refactoring fanatic who takes great joy from bringing good software design practices to chaotic code bases. On the product side, I typically work on getting teams to find a good fit with agile processes.”
