Russ is 18F's director of experience design, where he leads teams and projects in design and research. 

"Every one of our projects is an opportunity to work with government agencies who are so very invested in what we're all doing," he says. "It's exciting to partner with people who not only understand the value of user-centered design and development practices... they also request, if not demand, and embrace them, and are on board along for the ride."

Russ is the coauthor of A Project Guide to UX Design, Designing the Conversation, and Speaker Camp for New Riders (Voices That Matter). He is also the co-founder of ChicagoCamps (which hosts low-cost, high-value technology events in the Chicago area), and he sits on the Advisory Board for the Department of Web Design and Development at Harrington College of Design.

"There's this thing about doing government and civic work that I don't think I ever really expected to happen to me," he says. "The work we do *really* matters â€” and it matters to the best shareholders I could ever imagine working for: the citizens of the United States of America and those who engage with our government in any digital way. That's incredibly humbling to me. I'm motivated by that, and all the people here are similarly motivated by that, and it's a very present sort of feeling. I'm so incredibly fortunate to get to do this work with these wonderful people."
