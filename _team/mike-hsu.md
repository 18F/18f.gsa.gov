Mike's career started in the U.S. Marine Corps and after leaving the service, he spent several years working in software development. He's written code for large systems and managed projects and teams doing the same. All told, he has more than 30 years of experience working in the field. Prior to joining 18F, he was helping the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) manage their large datasets around trading and quotes.

A generalist, Mike came to 18F for a chance to participate in making the broader government more responsive and accessible, especially around data. "I want to be part of the team that helps transform the way that we deliver software and data solutions." Most recently, he's been building and managing the development and product management team, making sure they operate like a well-oiled machine and  deliver the highest value possible to our partner agencies.
