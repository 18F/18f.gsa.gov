Smita is the director of agency engagement for the Presidential Innovation Fellows program. Working with over 30 agencies, Smita finds the most impactful technology projects for the Presidential Innovation Fellows to work on, with the goal of finding projects that save millions of taxpayer dollars and touch millions of lives. 

"The PIF program fascinated me because of the huge opportunity for innovators to achieve massive scale for societal solutions, through leveraging government resources," she says.

Smita joined 18F from Ashoka, where she helped connect social entrepreneurs around the globe. She has also worked at the William J. Clinton Foundation's Economic Opportunity Initiative, where she supported women and minority entrepreneurs across the U.S. 

Outside of work, she serves on the founding team of the Millennial Trains Project, which runs transcontinental train journeys across the U.S. for young entrepreneurs and creatives, and she routinely speaks at colleges and on panels about her work.
