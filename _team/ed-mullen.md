Before he joined 18F, Ed Mullen studied fine art at The Cleveland Institute of Art. In 2001, he helped found NYC-based interactive design shop Squeaky Wheel Media, serving as creative director. He left five years later and began working independently as a designer with a wide variety of clients. In 2010, Ed spent five months at Department of Health and Human Services designing the first version of HealthCare.gov. In late 2012, he rejoined the HealthCare.gov effort, spending 14 months working on all aspects of design across the site. Most recently, he had been working with The Washington Post, helping them conceive and design forward thinking publishing tools that empower journalists right before he joined 18F in February 2016. 

“There's a lot about 18F to get excited about. 18F takes on projects that have real impact in the lives of people. The methods used to bring about this impact are progressive and modern, and they way 18F conducts its work in the open is bold and admirable,” he said about what attracted him to team. “The greatest lure for me, perhaps selfishly, was the team. 18F has been able to attract thoughtful and talented people who I've admired even before they joined 18F. Working with highly talented people, doing important work for clients who are engaged and want to do things right is a hard combination to beat.”

As a design generalist, Ed likes “to look at the broad challenges and opportunities of a project and find the best ways to meet the needs of the end user.”

“Time and again I find project teams who are mission driven, capable, and motivated, but have difficulty knowing where to start or how best to ensure they're solving the right problems. I like joining up with these teams to help them move ahead in meaningful ways,” Ed said.

He is part of the Change Strategy team where he “hopes to help our partners figure out successful and efficient ways to deliver value and impact to the people they serve.”
