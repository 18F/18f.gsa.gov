Lane Becker has been working on the Web pretty much since it was invented, starting with a work-study job for the University of Texas back in 1994. 

Later, Lane started internet companies — two very successful and one somewhat successful. Lane also worked for a few others, and wrote a business book that hit the New York Times bestseller list in 2012.

Right before joining 18F, Lane worked in the government space as the Director of Products and Startups for Code for America.

What attracted Lane to 18F was the “scale of the impact we can make.”

“The federal government serves over 300 million people, and the change to make a positive impact in their lives means everything to me. It's why I show up for work every day,” Lane said.

The skills and specialties Lane brings to the team include “digging into seemingly intractable problems and figuring out how to get started on fixing them.”

“I like making things go. I'm also an excellent hula hooper,” Lane said.

Lane is on the Strategy team, which is “tasked with helping figure out how to bring digital technology and thinking to the federal government in a real and systemic way.” Lane also said he and his colleagues  are tasked with “coming up with new and innovative ways that the government can apply technology to solve problems and help the public.”

Lane sees their projects “as a way to improve how the American government serve its public, and as an opportunity to improve the way the American public views its government.”
