Mike is practice director at 18F, leading the effort to spread organizational and development best practices throughout 18F and beyond. His projects include [the 18F Hub](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/12/23/hub/), which serves as a team documentation repository and as a map of the connections between team members, projects, and skill sets as well as [Snippets](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/12/17/snippets/), whereby team members summarize their week-to-week activities, which then are published both internally and publicly. Mike leads 18F's [Documentation Working Group](https://18f.gsa.gov/hub/wg/documentation/), co-leads 18F's [Testing Grouplet](https://18f.gsa.gov/hub/wg/testing/) and [Working Group Working Group](https://18f.gsa.gov/hub/wg/working-group/), and also helps manage the [18F Guides](http://18f.github.io/guides/), a repository of best practices published by 18F's various teams.

A former Googler, before working on websearch infrastructure, Mike helped drive the adoption of automated testing throughout the company as part of the Testing Grouplet and Test Mercenaries. Before that, at Northrop Grumman Mission Systems, he developed chart and radar rendering components for U.S. Coast Guard navigation and port monitoring systems. He holds bachelor's degrees in computer science and fine arts/theatre concentration from [Christopher Newport University](http://cnu.edu/), and has also studied electric guitar at [Berklee College of Music](https://www.berklee.edu/).

Mike has a knack for instigating [large-scale cultural change](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/12/11/large-scale-development-culture-change/) throughout organizations and really enjoys working at organizations that support transparency, collaboration, and autonomy.

"I'll just say that 18F has already proven the best job I've ever had, by far," he says. "I see it as my job not only to ensure 18F continues to cultivate the transparency, collaboration, and autonomy responsible for its success to date, but to do everything I possibly can to create the same thriving environment throughout the rest of the federal government."
