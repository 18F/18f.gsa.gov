Mike is Director of Practice at 18F, which means he leads the effort to create better internal documentation and communication throughout 18F. His projects include creating 18F's internal Hub, which serves as a repository for internal documentation, and [Snippets](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/12/17/snippets/), where team members write about their week-to-week activities, which then are published publicly. Mike leads 18F's Documentation Working Group and also helps manage 18F's Guides, a repository of best practices published by 18F's various teams.

A former Google employee, Mike has spent much of his career driving the adoption of automated testing. He has also developed chart and radar rendering components for US Coast Guard navigation and port monitoring systems. He has a bachelors degree in computer science from Christopher Newport University, and has also studied classical guitar at the Berklee College of Music.

Mike has a knack for instigating large-scale cultural change throughout organizations, and really enjoys working at organizations that support transparency, collaboration, and autonomy.

"I'll just say that 18F has already proven the best job I've ever had, by far," he says. "I see it as my job not only to ensure 18F continues to cultivate the transparency, collaboration, and autonomy responsible for its success to date, but to do everything I possibly can to create the same thriving environment  throughout the rest of the federal government."
