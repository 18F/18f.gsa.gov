Greg works on the team that builds, codes, and publishes 18F's website. 

In his words, "I tell people I help a team of 100 people who want to make their government better. The projects I work on directly support the work that everybody else on this team does. Having a better website and a robust blog helps us tell every American how their government is getting better and helps recruit more amazing people to join us."

Before 18F, Greg worked as a WordPress developer at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and spent two years teaching English as a foreign language in South Korea and Hungary. He started programming while living in Seoul, where he built a WordPress site for a journalism project he worked on with friends.

Greg first heard about 18F when some of the people he most admired from CFPB were detailed to GSA to help the organization get up off the ground.

"After seeing more people from CFPB and other organizations I admired start moving to 18F, I realized that this was the real deal," he says. "It's among the best decisions I've ever made. Until a couple years ago I always thought my programming would be a handy skill to augment my writing and communication work. Turns out that's true."
