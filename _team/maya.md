Maya is a designer and front end developer at 18F. "I make the stuff you see on the page," she says. "I've also grown deeply interested in accessibility and building for everyone. I believe design should make you think more clearly, feel more deeply, and behave more responsibly."

Before 18F, Maya was a Code for America fellow partnered with the City of San Antonio, where she worked with city officials to develop a web application to renovate housing safely and efficiently. She has also designed and developed websites for startups, the healthcare industry, and non-profit organizations. She has a degree in Art History from UCLA.

"I wanted to work at 18F because I’m passionate about making the world a better place," says Maya. "It’s easy to go into a hip, new startup and create a cool app. It’s hard to go into government, which is bound by centuries of history, and make something simple, intuitive, and meaningful. But that to me is much cooler, sexier, and more challenging."

Maya has worked on [CALC](https://calc.gsa.gov/), which lets contracting officers conduct market research on professional service labor categories more quickly and easily. She is also working on a project to create federal web design standards, which will create a unified look and system of components for federal government websites.
