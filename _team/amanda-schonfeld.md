“I joined 18F because I wanted to feel that my work had a higher
purpose. I have lots of experience working in the design and tech world,
and have had the opportunity to recruit people to build large commerce
sites and develop marketing campaigns to increase profits for products,
but I have never had an opportunity to do work where the ultimate
purpose is to make people's lives better. I had previously aspired to
finding an opportunity like that, but I also wanted to be sure that the
work being done was utilizing good design and strong technology
practices. 18F is transforming government by using research, good
design, and implementing helpful and sustainable technology to develop
tools and systems that allow for the American people to have successful
interactions with the United States government. What better way to make
an impact than that? I was totally excited and thrilled at the prospect
of joining 18F.”
