"I bring the ability to speak to customers to 18F." 

Jesse began his career at GSA in August 2013 with the Emerging Leaders Program. During his tenure at 18F, he'll work on creating a robust customer program aimed not only at continuing to deliver quality products but also a seamless customer experience.

Prior to coming to 18F, Jesse attended the Bucknell University, where he studied management with a concentration in finance and a dual major in comparative humanities. 

"Coming out of school, I was impressed with GSA for being on the cloud, using Google; once they announced the concept of 18F I knew it was somewhere I wanted to rotate through. I know that the connections I make here will help move GSA forward."
