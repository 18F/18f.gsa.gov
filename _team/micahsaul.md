Micah is a back end developer who focuses on data and data modeling.

"I try to make government data easier to understand and use," he says.

Armed with an array of languages - including Python and R - Micah came to 18F via Google, where he designed and maintained the schema for organizing information about people, places, and organizations. He's a five-time college dropout who found his way into tech via QA testing.

"After spending the majority of my life raging at broken systems — governmental and otherwise — I felt like 18F was doing something to help fix that," he says. 

Most recently, Micah helped display and parse FEC regulations in a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau project called eREgs. 

"It was a clear win for open source tech in government," he says.
