Ryan Sibley has worked as a writer, reportern and researcher for 8 years, focusing mainly on understanding the way government information and data is translated to its citizens.

She has worked with the Sunlight Foundation where she made government data understandable to the general public and provided tools they can use to inform themselves on issues.

“18F is an opportunity to improve citizens' experience from the inside,” she said. “People should be able to feel like the government is communicating effectively with them and the government should be trying to figure out what tools and information citizens need to improve their lives. I want to help with these things.”

Ryan specializes in translating “government speak.”

“I can help projects speak to their targeted audiences without leaving out important details or oversimplifying complex ideas,” she said. “I'm also skilled in piecing together information in order to tell whole, comprehensive stories when the information is otherwise scattered or incomplete.”
