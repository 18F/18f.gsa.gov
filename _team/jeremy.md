Jeremy is an experience designer and researcher whose job is to build our understanding of how people outside of government work and live, so we can build things that fit seamlessly and delightfully into their lives. Jeremy's first project that shipped at 18F was with Peace Corps, centered around the Let Girls Learn initiative. He's also co-coordinator of the research guild, which helps our projects maintain laser focus on the user. 

Jeremy has dipped in and out of public service throughout his career. He got his start at the Government Accountability Office where he learned a lot about how government operates, the power of serendipity, and consensus-driven organizations. He got his first taste of talking to users before building tools. 

"It only made me want more," he says.

After graduating from the Michigan's School of Information, Jeremy became a part of the first class of Code for America Fellows. Since then, he has split his time between private and public sector, client services, startups, and freelancing before starting at 18F. 

"I see in 18F the possibility of creating new relationships with citizens - relationships that aren't mired in corrosive partisanship but instead are based on the belief that we can work together to build the society we want. This is admittedly a bit hopelessly idealistic, but it's tempered by the method of getting there: We are taking small, discrete steps and validating at every opportunity that we're on the right track."
