Jeremy is an experience designer and researcher who's job is to build our understanding of how people outside of government work and live, so we can build things that fit seamlessly and delightfully into their lives. Jeremy's first project at 18F, which shipped, was with Peace Corps, centered around the Let Girls Learn initiative and is co-coordinator of the research guild, which is aimed at helping our projects stay laser focused on the user. 

Jeremy has dipped in and out of public service throughout his career. He got his start at the Government Accountability Office where he leared a lot about how governement operates, the power of serendipity and consensus driven organizations. He also "got my first taste of talking to users before building tools, and it only made me want more." After graduating from the Michigan's School of Information, Jeremy became apart of the first class of Code for America Fellows. Since then, he has split his time between private and public sector, client services, start-ups, and freelancing before starting at 18F. 

"I see in 18F the possibility of creating new relationships with citizens that isn't mired in corrosive partisanship, but that helps us work together to create a society we want together. This grand vision is admittedly a bit hopelessly idealistic, but it's tempered by the method of getting there: we are taking small, discrete steps and validating at every opportunity that we're on the way."
