Julia is a designer and developer at 18F. She primarily codes in Python/Django but also dabbles with Ruby on Rails, node/npm, and Angular.js, depending on the project she's tackling. 

"Each of the projects I get to work on is extremely challenging, based on the complexity of the user experience and how we approach the solution," she says. "At 18F, I help create interfaces, experiences, and code bases that are accessible on multiple fronts."

A frequent public speaker, Julia is also the author of "Lightweight Django," published by O'Reilly Media, and the founder of the Girl Develop It chapter in Raleigh-Durham, where she's taught dozens of classes to empower women through coding. She started her career as a web designer at Hallmark Cards and then developed applications, designed templates, and wrote client-side documentation at World Online in Lawrence, Kansas.

"From creating well-maintained and structured open source code to designs that bring delight to our users, the goals around these are the same: create good work," Julia says. "I wanted to join 18F because of the opportunity to give back to my country and to be part of the movement to change the way the federal government views itself and its workflow processes."
