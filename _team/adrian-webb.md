After teaching himself how to program by developing models to study financial markets in the late 90s, Adrian eventually went to the Univeristy of Cincinnati and The City University of New York, Brooklyn College to study computer science and economics. That set him on the path that led through major media and technology companies and, eventually, 18F.

"I have been following 18F since its inception," Adrian said when he joined in October 2015. "I am passionate about open source software and shared platforms that can help not just the original stakeholders but anyone who has that same or similar need." And indeed he has built a career around large systems resting on open source tools.

It was the government's mission to serve the public that drew him to 18F, and his feeling that 18F's role in that mission could "have substantial benefits in helping the government provide better services, faster, and more reliably." He is a technologist at heart and loves every aspect of building and delivering it to users. "My goal is to help U.S. agencies get the most from their digital systems, development processes, and technology teams," and he's done just that in his role on the cloud.gov team and with 18F Consulting.
