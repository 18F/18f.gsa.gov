Brad's skills are focused on the core pillars of user experience - user research, information architecture, and interaction design. His roots are in user research, and he approaches every problem with that in mind, always asking how and why someone would do something. 

"If those answers aren't available, I try to find ways to get to the answer so every design decision is backed with as much data as possible," he says.

Brad got his degree in computer science but quickly learned that a life of coding was not for him. Luckily, he stumbled across human-computer interaction and usability; his passion was found. Prior to 18F, he worked in the private sector at a technology consulting firm, which had its own experience design agency. He had the pleasure of working with clients around the country in just about every industry. 

"The move to 18F was a simple one for me, as it allows me to get back to the roots as to why I became a designer. There is a lot of pain and frustration when it comes to interacting with digital environments, and it simply doesn't have to be that way. The goals and culture of 18F align perfectly with why I became a user experience professional in the first place."
