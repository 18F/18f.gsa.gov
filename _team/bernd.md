Bernd is the technical account manager for 18F Products and Platforms. His current focus is cloud.gov, a platform that allows government agencies and their developers to get applications up and running quickly. Bernd assists agencies in assessing and procuring cloud.gov, and he onboards new developers to cloud.gov.

Before 18F, Bernd worked on the Google Cloud Platform team where he provided architecture recommendations for developers. He also scaled support teams and operations for Google Apps. In addition to work at startups (for example in credit card and signup fraud detection), he worked at Twitter where he managed technical partnerships and evangelized tools for mobile application development. He has a degree in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics from Macalester College.

Bernd joined 18F because he loves working with talented, passionate people dedicated to a good cause. At 18F he has a unique opportunity to apply his skills and interest in cloud computing (and Platform as a Service in particular) with his desire to make a difference and help people.
