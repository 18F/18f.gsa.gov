A full stack developer, Josh is most comfortable coding in Python and Javascript but is always interested in learning new tools.

He joined 18F from the Center for Open Science, where he wrote open source software for scientists. He holds a doctorate in cognitive neuroscience from the University of Michigan and a bachelor's degree in psychology from Haverford College.

"At risk of cliche, I was drawn to 18F because I wanted to make a difference," he says. "18F offers a unique opportunity to have a positive impact across government services and their users â€” there aren't many places with more public impact per line of code. The development team is much like what you'd find at a typical industry startup: full of talented, intellectually curious people committed to delivering high-quality code. The difference is that the code is in the public domain, and everything we do is focused on improving public services."
