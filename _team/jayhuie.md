Jay Huie has spent over 15 years guiding the evolution and adoption of technology within federal and enterprise environments. His expertise includes bringing a multi-discipline approach to help agencies.

Jay has had experience as a developer, system administrator, policy wonk, architect, and technology executive. Prior to joining 18F, Jay worked with agencies such as the Federal Reserve Board, Department of Energy, and Department of State to establish and manage initiatives including data management services, cloud computing infrastructure, and strategic governance through the practical application of enterprise architecture and capital planning and management activities.

“I have always felt the desire to integrate capabilities across Government, and promote a collaborative approach to our collective mission to provide services and opportunities for the public,” Jay said. “I am driven by a desire for ‘infinite ROI’ where one agency problem can be solved by another agency's existing solution - if only the dots are connected, and the bridges built.”

At 18F, Jay said he enjoys “balancing traditional and the modern techniques for realizing the results we all hope to have for our nation.”
