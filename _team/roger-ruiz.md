Roger Steve Ruiz is a self-taught software developer that found his place in web development by coming in through the window, specifically the browser window. 

Coming from a traditional graphic design background, CSS and system designs were two things that felt natural. As he learned more about the history of and fundamentals of programming, he made his transition to full-stack development.

“After years working in the advertising industry, I wanted a change that would make a real impact in the world using software,” Roger said about why he wanted to join 18F.

His specialties include front-end architecture, automation and tooling as well as JavaScript on the client and the server.

At 18F, Roger is a web developer who enjoys “helping build software that will make interacting with government services as easy as ordering a meal or a book online.”

Roger views projects at 18F as “umbrellas that cover or overlap many aspects of how people interact with the government."

"Whether it's interagency interactions like the Open Opportunities platform or the Federal Front Door welcoming civilians into necessary interactions with the government, I see the projects I am working on as a web that helps bring down walls around information or shed light into perceived black box processes," Roger said.
