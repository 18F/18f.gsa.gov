Jez helps teams at 18F deploy and operate new systems, and runs the
infrastructure they sit on. His focus is enabling continuous
delivery of secure, resilient distributed systems even in the highly
regulated context of government.

Before joining 18F, Jez spent over fifteen years tinkering with
code, infrastructure, and product development in companies of varying
sizes across three continents. He is the award-winning author of three
books: _Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build,
Test, and Deployment Automation_, _Lean Enterprise: How High
Performance Organizations Innovate at Scale_, and _The DevOps
Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security
in Technology Organizations_. He also teaches classes on software
development and product management at UC Berkeley's
[School of Information](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/). 

"Here in the GSA's Technology Transformation Service we're showing
that agile, devops and open source development can be business as
usual even in the complex, highly regulated domain of
government. We're using these ideas to help our agency partners
build world-class user-centered services that transform the way
government serves its people, while also saving enormous amounts of
money for taxpayers. That's an amazing mission, and it's an honor to
serve with the incredible team at the GSA behind it."
