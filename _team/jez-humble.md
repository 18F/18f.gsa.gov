I joined 18F for a few reasons. First, I’m a big fan of what the UK’s
GDS has been doing, and I wanted to be able to contribute to the U.S.
government’s move towards building people-centered digital government
services. I see that as a vitally important mission, and for selfish
reasons 18F was ideal because they have an office in San Francisco, and
they are a remote-first team (we use a lot of Slack and Screenhero),
which means I can work from home much of the week. Second, I get to use
cutting-edge technology. I’ve spent the past month working on the[
](http://cloud.gov/)[*cloud.gov*](http://cloud.gov/) team, where we’re
building a cloud for government using CloudFoundry and AWS. Recently
we’ve been building out monitoring using Riemann, InfluxDB and Grafana,
and it’s been fun to get my hands dirty on that. Third, I’m getting to
work with some really great people.
