Elizabeth is a design researcher at 18F. She studies how people live to
design and develop tools that support them. Over the course of a project, she
might translate relevant scholarly work into action; break down large,
complicated questions into smaller projects to prioritize them; map the
cultural and social landscapes that new products and services will inhabit;
and facilitate the participation of future users and other project
constituencies in decision-making.

“I see myself as a facilitator of a more inclusive and participatory design process — one that seeks out multiple viewpoints and weaves them into the design process,” she says. “I try to be helpful while asking hard questions.”

Elizabeth’s professional background lies mostly in qualitative design research
for research and development or early stage product design. She has helped many companies frame
their problems, explore possible solutions, and set agendas for the future.
She has a bachelor's degree in art from Yale, a master’s degree in interaction design from New
York University, and a PhD from UC Berkeley’s School of Information
Sciences. She has taught classes at UC Berkeley and the San Francisco Art
Institute, is the author of two books and also speaks and leads workshops
at a variety of conferences.

Elizabeth came to work at 18F for three reasons: She likes working on projects
that are technically challenging, she has a strong interest in civic
service design, and she wanted to give back to the U.S. government, which
financially supported her in graduate school via a National Science
Foundation Graduate Fellowship.

“I’m tremendously grateful,” she says, “and working for 18F is one way to say thank you.”
