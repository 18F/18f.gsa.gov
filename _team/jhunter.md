Jeannine works on the communications team, where she tells 18F's story through blog posts, case studies, and social media. She also works as a content strategist, writing and revising content used on federal government websites. "I am passionate about community building and technology," she says. "I want to help audiences beyond the walls of governmental institutions understand how it works, and help improve it, and I am excited to share 18F’s successes and the lessons we learn with other federal agencies, the tech industry, and civic tech communities."

Before 18F, Jeannine worked as an editor, a web producer, and as a newspaper reporter, charged with covering different institutions, issues, and ideologies throughout the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions. She holds a masters in information sciences and has always incorporated a multitude of digital tools into her work.

"I was drawn to 18F by the prospect of helping a new dev shop within the government tell its story, define its narrative/mission/ethos, and connect what it does with a desire to make government more efficient, accessible, accountable, and transparent," she says."And I see 18F as an environment where I can grow as a technologist because I'm surrounded by people who are much smarter than me yet very helpful. I applaud our collaborative spirit."
