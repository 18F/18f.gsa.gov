Mossadeq comes to 18F in the midst of a long career in technology and the government. After earning a BS in Computer Systems Engineering from University of Arkansas he worked as a Software Engineer at AOL and later shifted his focus to Information Security after completing a Graduate Certificate program in Information Assurance from George Washington University. His expertise is now in Digital Identity and Access Management where he's spent more than 10 years helping federal and private companies implement technical solutions.

"The idea of improving how government does business with our fellow citizens by empowering them," was something that attracted Mossadeq to 18F as well as "the drive to modernize and standardize using Open Source technology across the board for the federal IT space." He also saw an opportunity to work with a creative and innovative team that roll up their sleeves every day and try to make a difference so that "good enough for the government" means something to be proud of.

He considers himself a generalist and enjoys learning about new trends, getting his hands on the next big thing before it's a big thing, and finding the best fit for it. "Be it Software Engineering or InfoSec Engineering, I enjoy it all." However my current expertise that I bring to 18F is my working knowledge of Public Key Infrastructure and solutions orbiting around that technology to solve security challenges.

At 18F he delivers clean, maintainable, secure solutions so that people who are going to be using that unique technology, no matter who they are or how they do it, have the confidence and assurance that the tech they are using is secure and safe.
