Jen started designing in the branding world but was looking for work with meaning and a social impact. "To me, it's important to be intentional about why design decisions are made, and not just make something that's aesthetically pleasing. It's important to me that visual design serves and supports the communications goals of any product and system, and I try to do that in a compelling, clear, and concise way."

Prior to 18F, Jen worked as a freelance designer. During this time she was a design fellow with Public Policy Lab in Brooklyn, researching human-centered approaches to improving care and outcomes for high-needs populations—such as people with mental illness or addiction problems—in overcrowded Louisville, KY jail. In 2013, Jen recieved her MS in Communications Design from Pratt. 

When asked why she wanted to work at 18F, "Really though, the people. The people at 18F are an incredible group.  They individually and collectively inspire me with their drive to make a difference in the way things are done in government."
