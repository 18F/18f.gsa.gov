Michelle Hertzfeld is a designer at 18F, with experience in UX, visual design, HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. She’s currently working on FBOpen, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, and the 18F site.

Before coming to 18F, Michelle taught ranchers to use geospatial information, became involved with NOAA’s international environmental data exchange, and worked as a PIF for the Department of the Interior, among other things. She holds degrees in Mandarin and Environmental Policy.

Michelle believes that “we deserve a government that provides quality, efficient, trustworthy services, and that the roadblocks that are preventing this are movable.” She joined 18F to help bring clarity, transparency, and ease of use to citizen services.
