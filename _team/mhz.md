Michelle Hertzfeld is a designer at 18F with experience in UX, visual design, HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. She’s currently working on the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and College Choice.

Before coming to 18F, Michelle taught ranchers to use geospatial information, worked at NOAA’s Satellite Service on international environmental data exchange, and served as a Presidential Innovation Fellow for the Department of the Interior, among other things. She holds degrees in Mandarin and environmental policy. She joined 18F to help bring clarity, transparency, and ease of use to government services.

Michelle believes that “we deserve a government that provides quality, efficient, trustworthy services, and that the roadblocks that are preventing this are movable.”
