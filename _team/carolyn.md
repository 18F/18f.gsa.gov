"I see my role as making sure that the tools we build allow citizens to successfully engage with the government, taking their perspective and needs into account in the design process. I want to help create better relationships between citizens and the agencies that serve them."

Carolyn got her BFA in graphic design from Ohio University and a master's degree in nonprofit management from Indiana University. Soon Carolyn grew into the role of managing three websites for a national, education-focused nonprofit where she started teaching herself UX practices. After moving to Atlanta, she  landed an interaction design position at Turner Broadcasting (parent company for TBS, CNN, Cartoon Network), where she expanded her skills to include more robust research techniques.  

When asked why she joined 18F, Carolyn says "it's commitment to user-centric design, open source, and iterative workflows. Working here is a great way for me to combine my passion for great design with my desire to put something good out into the world."
