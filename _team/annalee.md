Annalee is a back end developer at 18F who works mostly in Python frameworks like Django and Flask. 

"I build the parts of a website the user doesn't see," she says. "When you load a page, there's a lot going on under the hood for the page to serve you the correct content, do any needed math, etc. The same thing happens when you submit information. I write the code that makes those under-the-hood operations go."

Before joining 18F, Annalee worked at an open government startup and for Congress. She taught herself how to code during evenings and weekends, with extensive help and support from other women in tech.

She says she joined 18F for two reasons. "The first was the chance to write open source code for the American people," she says. "Public service has always been a big deal in my family — my father is a firefighter and my mother is a nonprofit lobbyist. At 18F, we have an opportunity to work on projects that have a profound impact on people’s lives."

Annalee says the second reason she joined 18F was the collaborative nature of the work environment. 

"Working with dedicated, talented people who care deeply about the quality of our code has really helped me learn and grow as a developer," she says.
