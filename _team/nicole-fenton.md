Nicole spent the last few years consulting, teaching workshops, writing and editing books for people who make websites, and speaking at conferences. Before that she was a content strategist focused on consumer and developer platform products, privacy, and content strategy for various tech companies in San Francisco. She came to 18F for the opportunity to make better websites and processes for the people of the United States. "The fact that 18F is remote-friendly and encourages working in public only made me more interested," she said about why she joined 18F.

She's a writer, editor, and strategist. She can do a little bit of everything in the user experience space but the things that most excite her all relate back to writing: "clarifying goals, thinking about audiences, developing style guidelines and standards, setting up editorial frameworks, and working with the words themselves."

She sees her job "to make things clear, conversational, easy to read, and easy to translate." At 18F she's worked with [the United States Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative (USEITI)](https://useiti.doi.gov) where she helped the U.S. Department of the Interior present complicated information about how public land gets used for natural resource development, and how the government distributes the rents, royalties, and other money collected from those leases.
