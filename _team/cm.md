CM Lubinski is a backend developer at 18F. Based in Pittsburgh, he has worked on a redesigned donations site for the Peace Corps, a proxy for federal APIs, a credit-card approval system for the General Services Administration, and a regulation parser and viewer for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

CM came to 18F from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where he served as a Technology &amp; Innovation Fellow. Prior to that, he worked at a variety of Chicago startups. He holds a master’s degree in computer science. 

CM says he was attracted to 18F because of the scale of the projects he could work on. 

“I think 18F and the GSA are the right place to work on infrastructure projects — things that help all of the federal government rather than a single agency/organization,” he says. “There’s great potential in having a view which cuts across the federal space. We can achieve a good balance between working on individual client projects and making something a bit bigger and better.”
