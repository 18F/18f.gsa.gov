Marco designs websites and user interfaces for various government agencies. He most recently worked on Let Girls Learn, a new static site launched by the Peace Corps.

Before 18F, Marco worked as a software engineer for several startups. He holds a bachelor's degree in graphic design from San Francisco State University.

"I strive to put my skillset to its best use, which I currently believe is helping the government provide better technological services to it's citizens and the world," he says.
