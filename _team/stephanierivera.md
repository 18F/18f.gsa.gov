Stephanie works with people across the federal government to make 18F a great place to work. As Director of Business Strategy, she is on the front line of new projects, ensuring that 18F projects meet our impact and user-centered goals.   She is also working to optimize our current performance by ensuring 18F has the right internal policices and procedures in place for success, growth and logevity. 

Stephanie says she has always been drawn to the motivations of people, organizations, and political structures. After receiving a masters degree in US foreign policy and national security, she began her career in the intelligence community, before transitioning to organizational design work, and finally as the Chief of Staff for a office specializing in government-wide policy. For the past 15 years, she has helped launch, revamped and turned around several new offices within federal agencies and GSA.

"When asked to join GSA, I jumped at the opportunity to work on government policy issues from the inside," she says ."In the past four years Iâ€™ve experienced first hand the difficulties in trying to attract and retain technical talent either through hiring or as a result of the acquisitions process.  18F is lucky to be charged with such a worthy mission. I sincerely believe there is no greater mechanisim for positive change than the federal government."
