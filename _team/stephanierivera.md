Stephanie works with people across the federal government to make 18F a great place to work. Her projects include the structure of the office, teleworking policies, benefits issues, reappointments, employee relations and answering tricky ethical questions.

Stephanie says she has always been drawn to the motivations of people, organizations, societies, and political structures. After receiving a masters degree in US foreign policy and national security, she began her career in the intelligence community, before transitioning to organizational design work. For the past four years, she has helped launch several new offices within federal agencies and GSA.

"When asked to join GSA, I jumped at the opportunity to work on government policy issues from the inside," she says ."In the past four years Iâ€™ve experienced first hand the difficulties in trying to attract and retain technical talent either through hiring or as a result of the acquisitions process.  18F is lucky to be charged with such a worthy mission. I sincerely believe that there is no greater multiplier for positive impact than the federal government.
