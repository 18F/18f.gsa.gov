"I help understand the problem, the users, and ask the right questions to adequately scope the goals and objectives so we can quickly develop and deliver the right products," Andrew says. "I help develop internal tools and products for the program to operate more effectively, support the fellows as they execute and ship products, and serve as a technical resource for agencies who want to identify projects that will effectively leverage fellows and their time."

Previously, Andrew cofounded a security software startup within the identity and access management sector, built giant fighting robots designed for glorious arena combat, and cofounded a nonprofit makerspace focused on access to industrial grade tools and education. He was also a contestant on the Discovery Channel's The Big Brain Theory, a team-based reality TV competition where contestants go head-to-head against some of the brightest minds in the country.

Andrew has served as a Department of Defense civilian focused on the Biosurveillance White House Initiative as the informatics subject matter expert and integration lead under the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense. His support to the armed forces also included oversight of medical countermeasures and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear material development as well as joint strike fighter integration efforts.

Prior to civilian service, he specialized in fluid power design, modeling and simulation, and contamination control, where his work spanned private and public sectors. Andrew earned dual bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering and mechanical engineering with a focus on mathematics and business management from Oklahoma State University.

"The PIF program, with the support of the White House and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, breaks through many of the barriers I previously faced and enables outside industry tech leaders to come into the government and succeed in delivering products and solutions," he says.
