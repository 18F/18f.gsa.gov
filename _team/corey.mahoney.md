Before finding content strategy, Corey Mahoney worked at a law firm, sold books in Harvard Square, and taught freshman English. 

“I'm good at omitting needless words, asking ‘why’ an annoying number of times, wrestling large piles of content, and creating connections (between content and between people),” Corey said.

She came to content strategy through marketing, then she joined the University of California Office of the President, where she helped launch several major properties, socialize a CMS, and develop a process for considering user needs in web projects. 

“Good content on government sites can help build trust, foster civic engagement, and get out of people's way as they're going about their lives. Also, all of the humans who work here are crazy smart and bizarrely kind,” she said.
