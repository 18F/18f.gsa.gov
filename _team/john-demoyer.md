Having the chance to work on distributed teams was one of the main
reasons I joined 18F. I love knowing that the people building products
for the American public are spread out all over the country. Re-thinking
the way I collaborate on designs to accommodate a team that spans 3
time-zones has been one of the most exciting parts of my job.
