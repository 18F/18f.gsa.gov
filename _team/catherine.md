Catherine Devlin is a back end developer who specializes in database-related development and data extraction. 

As she describes it, "We're building faster, easier, clearer, cheaper, and more open ways 
for citizens to access and use their government's information. 
I work on the servers that hold the information and make them cooperate."

Before 18F, Catherine worked as a PostgreSQL/Oracle/MySQL database administrator 
and a Python developer for several companies, including a decade with an Air Force contractor.
She holds a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from MIT. 
When she's not at work, she leads the Dayton Dynamic Languages user group 
and works on PyOhio, the Python conference she founded.

Catherine joined 18F because she says she couldn't pass up the chance to work for the public good. 

"My years as an Air Force contractor left me longing to see improvements in government's way of doing business," she says. 

"When I learned that 18F actually had a practical plan for making things better, I couldn't stay away. 
It's hard to aspire to much more than just being part of our overall accomplishment, namely: 
quick, cheap, top-quality work that demonstrates the value of open source and open processes 
and helps them to spread throughout government."
