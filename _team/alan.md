Alan deLevie is on the 18F Consulting team. His previous 18F projects include the MyUSA shared service and myUSCIS for our U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services clients, primarily doing Ruby on Rails development on both projects. He also builds accessibility tools and works with 18F's API program.

Before 18F, Alan interned in Congress, at the Federal Communications Commission, and for a trade organization. At each, he found himself either working on technology policy or coding to make projects easier to manage. He studied communications policy and political science at Penn State, where he coded projects for the school newspaper. He recently graduated law school and also co-organizes D.C. Legal Hackers.

Alan joined 18F because he has experienced what he calls "hair-on-fire" moments while trying to use government websites.

"18F is a place where we work to fix these types of problems every single day," he says. "Everyone has this shared goal to restore faith in what a government website can and should be. Where else can I one day work on technology that could conceivably improve millions of persons' first interaction with the US government bureaucracy, and then the next go work on login infrastructure that could one day serve the entire federal government?"

About 18F, he says there's "a series of great moments where you're encouraged to follow your natural instincts about the right way to do something. Almost every single day here, I see people helping each other learn new concepts or techniques and providing a great place for teammates of all roles to grow."
