Kimber comes to 18F excited to be a part of our efforts to promote a collaborative environment while working on large infrastructure projects. She is passionate about privacy, encryption, and building user-driven technology for the public.

"I'm an Information Security professional. I have a master's degree from an institution of higher learning. I've had a lot of really cool jobs. I have a few certifications and I've attended a lot of really great trainings." Kimber says, "Infosec is so fetch!" 

Kimber's background is in Information Security, Incident Response, Security Policy, and Penetration Testing. In short, Kimber breaks things, fixes things, and gets root for fun and profit. Joining the DevOps team here at 18F, her goal is to give our infrastructure a giant, protective hug.
