Kimber comes to 18F excited to be apart of our efforts to promote a collaborative environment and positive office culture, and to work on large infrastructure projects.

"I'm an Information Security professional. I have a Master's Degree from an institution of higher learning. I've had a lot of really cool jobs. I have a few certifications and I've attended a lot of really great trainings. Infosec is so fetch!"

Prior to 18F, Kimber's background is in Infosec, Sec Policy, System on Chip (SOC), Network Operations Center (NOC), System Administration, Application Support, and QA. In short, she breaks things, fixes things, and gets to the root for fun and profit. Joining the DevOps team here at 18F, their goal is to give infrastructure a giant, protective hug.
