Kimber comes to 18F excited to be a part of our efforts to promote a collaborative environment while working on large infrastructure projects.

"I'm an Information Security professional. I have a master's degree from an institution of higher learning. I've had a lot of really cool jobs. I have a few certifications and I've attended a lot of really great trainings," Kimber says. "Infosec is so fetch!"

Prior to 18F, Kimber's background is in Infosec, Incident Response, Security Policy, Network Security, Application Support, and QA. In short, Kimber breaks things, fixes things, and gets root for fun and profit. Joining the DevOps team here at 18F, her goal is to give infrastructure a giant, protective hug.
