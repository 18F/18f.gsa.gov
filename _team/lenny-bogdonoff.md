Lenny is an artist-turned designer-turned programmer-turned digital product maker. 

He is also a full-stack Ruby developer and a digital translator who takes “the needs and wants of government employees and turn it into functional software.”

Lenny has a liberal arts degree with a concentration in the humanities from Soka University of America where he researched the impact of digital technologies on culture and social behavior. He lived in Shanghai for a year where he worked in a tech startup and began my career in Fortune 100 e-commerce before he moved to New York and decided to explore the media industry's print-to-digital transition. As a developer, he worked at Conde Nast brands including W Magazine, Bon Appetit, and the New Yorker. 

“I am fascinated by the civic space. I've always wanted to contribute to the nonprofit space or government,” he said about why he wanted to join 18F. “Since I learned about the space connecting government and tech, I wanted to get involved. 18F was the best place where I saw passionate people who worked on problems they cared about. I've been repeatedly impressed by the people who work at 18F and aspire to develop similarly.”
