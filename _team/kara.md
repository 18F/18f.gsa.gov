As senior advisor to the executive director, Kara focuses on strategy and culture at 18F. Her background is a mix of private and public sector experience, including 6 years with Intuit/TurboTax and an appointment to the first class of White House Presidential Innovation Fellows. As an Intuit Innovation Catalyst, she helped people use human-centered design to tackle the company’s biggest challenges and turn them into opportunities to delight folks.

According to her 2nd grade report card, Kara “likes to talk. A lot.” Which makes sense that this former journalist and long-time Distinguished Toastmaster (DTM) would still be working to create experiences where we talk to people like they're humans, not robots. Previous experience also includes the Oscars, Emmys, Super Bowl, and Women's World Cup. One constant in her career: placing herself in a position where she can do the most good for the most people.
