As deputy director of 18F Consulting, Kara focuses on digital strategy, operations, and communications. Her goals are to foster a strong team culture where folks feel empowered do the best work of their career, make the digital services the people interact with more usable and useful, and influence experiences that, yes, maybe even make the interactions delightful.

Her background is a mix of private and public sector experience, including 6 years with Intuit/TurboTax and an appointment to the first class of White House Presidential Innovation Fellows. As an Intuit Innovation Catalyst, she helped folks use design thinking to tackle the companyâ€™s biggest challenges and dream up new, user-centric creations.

Previous experience also includes the Oscars, Super Bowl, and Women's World Cup. One constant in her career: being in a position to do the most good for the most people.
