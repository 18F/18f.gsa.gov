Gabriel is a backend developer on the openFOIA project. His work consists of building new features for openFOIA — like contact forms and full-text searching — as well as scraping, cleaning, and validating data. He is well-versed in Python, statistical modeling, network analysis, machine learning and Django/Flask.

Before 18F, Gabriel was a data analyst at the Department of State, where he worked on social network analysis and optimizing targeted campaigns. His programming and data science experience was largely acquired on the job and through free coursework online. He holds a B.A. in Sociology and Anthropology and a masters in Arabic language.

Gabriel joined 18F because he was attracted by 18F's transparency and openness. "18F’s team is also really impressive," he says. "I felt it would be the perfect place to work on interesting projects and continue learning."
