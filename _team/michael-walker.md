Before joining 18F, Greg Walker worked at the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, the Army's only R&D center under the Corps of Engineers umbrella.  

“There, I worked on projects including disaster response and relief, force protection, and, most recently, acquisitions streamlining,” Greg said.

He grew up in Starkville, MS, and went to school at Mississippi State University where he received a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. 

When asked why he joined 18F, he said, “I enjoy working in the public sector because I feel like I have the opportunity to positively influence things in a way that is difficult to do in a profit-motivated organization.

“18F feels like the direction my previous lab was heading, but further along and with bigger reach. I want to be a part of the revolution that 18F is trying to bring because I believe it's the right thing,” he said.

Greg prefers working on the back-end, but he can do front-end coding as well. For the last couple of years, he has worked almost exclusively in Javascript, but he’s also spent considerable time with Objective-C and C# in the past.
