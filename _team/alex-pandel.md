You would be justified in calling me a social impact junkie. I've been
working in the civic technology space for several years, and feel like
I've found my professional happy place in using the powers of
human-centered design to help government better serve the American
people in the digital age. However, my career before 18F was always
focused on the local level, so the prospect of putting my skills and
experience to work at the federal level was really exciting, since the
amount of potential impact that our work can have on people's lives
becomes just mind-boggling at that national scale. Plus, having worked
at very small organizations for most of my career, I was really drawn to
the giant well of talent here at 18F, and it's been incredible to work
with such a huge variety of ridiculously talented people whom I get to
learn from every day.
