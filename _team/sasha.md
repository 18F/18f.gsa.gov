Sasha Magee is a developer at 18F, where he works on software projects that help people interact with the government more pleasantly and efficiently.

Sasha has spent the past two decades working in the tech industry, most recently at a children’s book startup. Before that, he alternated working for Adobe and for himself.

He joined 18F because he deeply believes in helping the government work best for those who need it most. 

“I’m currently working on an immigration project, and I hope to help make what is many people’s first experience with the U.S. government a positive one,” he says.
