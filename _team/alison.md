Alison is a developer whose specialties include how to use and munge messy datasets, automated software testing, SQL, and database tuning. Though her preferred tech stack is Python, Django/Flask, and PostgreSQL, she can also work in Ruby and Rails, Node.js, Perl, Javascript and PHP, and has experience with Elasticsearch.

She is the tech lead for FBOpen and has also spent time on the Discovery and FEC teams, where she rewrote an API layer to be quick and performant on a database of tens of millions of records. 

"To each team, I try to bring my strengths in writing APIs, automated testing, and database performance to try and really drive and reinforce solid software development practices," she says. "My vision for the work that I do is to change the relationship of the U.S. people to their government. Technology has become so much more than just websites and computers. We're now in the position to be able to change people's lives by making the important stuff they need to do easier, faster, and better. I hope my work can be a step towards that end."

Alison started programming as a child. In high school, she started a family business doing web development, and in college, she ran her own software as a service company. She fell in love with back end development and big databases while getting her start in the corporate world in the TV ratings industry. She joined 18F after serving as a Presidential Innovation Fellow and working at the Sunlight Foundation.

She joined 18F because she wanted to be part of a team that will transform the way our government works. 

"18F has been the best job I've ever had in terms of being able to have a work-life balance and follow my career while raising a family," she says.
