Victor's a user experience designer who sometimes moonlights as a front-end developer. He is currently working on a project to improve the online FOIA request process for the American people.

Victor joined 18F from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where he helped build the agency's first digital presence and identity. He has also worked with the [White House Initiative on Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders](http://whitehouse.gov/aapi) where he learned a lot about doing outreach in communities with limited English proficiency. "I’ve since spent a lot of time thinking about how to create services for that community, who are often ignored when it comes to technology," he says.

He has also spent time working as a design/developer for a digital firm and for Barack Obama's web team during the 2008 Presidential campaign. He built his first website at the age of 12 - he notes it had a flaming animated gif as a horizontal bar - and earned a degree in Technocultural Studies from the University of California, Davis.

He came to 18F specifically to work on FOIA. "I spent some time as a blogger in a past life and I saw my colleagues slug through what seemed to be a plodding and frustrating process," he says. "The chance to work on the FOIA project was compelling, but I wasn’t quite yet sold until I interviewed with 18F. Seeing the tremendous talent for technology and passion for public service and user-centered design made me know that something special is happening here, and I felt that I could bring something to the table."
