Jen, who leads the hiring team at 18F, specializes in setting strategy and making it operational. 

"Just like in our tech projects, the approaches we use in recruitment and workforce planning are also agile," she says. "We design, invent, deliver, and continue to obtain user feedback for ongoing improvements."

A recovering management consultant, Jen has worked with several Fortune 500 companies, large and small non-profits, and nearly every government agency to develop and operationalize strategies that have enabled these organizations to be high-functioning. Jen is also the founder of the You're Not Pretty Enough project, which aims to build higher self-esteem through the exploration of beauty norms and their impact on the individual.

Jen says she has one criteria when it comes to employment: to be engaged. 

"When I heard more about 18F, I thought, 'There's no way I'll be more engaged than helping the government digitize and streamline its services for Americans,'" she says. "And it's proved to be true - it's the most engaged I've ever been in a job."
