Melody Kramer is a member of 18F’s outreach team and recently spearheaded the effort to reinvision 18F's onboarding process. She frequently consults with teams across the organization on audience, content, and digital strategies. Her specialties include audience-centered design, writing and editing, coding, and developing systems-wide processes. She enjoys writing tutorials and making 18F’s work more open and accessible.

Melody joins 18F from NPR, where she worked as a digital strategist and editor. She is a Peabody-award winning journalist, a Visiting Nieman Fellow, and frequently contributes to a wide variety of publications. 

After reading Eric Mill’s blog post about working in public, Melody knew she wanted to join 18F. 

“I was really attracted to the idea of working at an organization that strongly believes that good, forward-thinking work can be completed in the public sector," she says. "And I wanted to help change the way the government builds and thinks about products or websites that millions of people interact with on a daily basis."
