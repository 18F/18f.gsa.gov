Melody Kramer is a member of 18F’s blog and content teams and frequently consults with other teams across the organization on audience, content, and digital strategies. Her specialties include audience-centered design, writing and editing, coding, and building tools with audiences — not for them. She enjoys writing tutorials and making 18F’s work more open and accessible.

Melody joins 18F from NPR, where she worked as a digital strategist and editor. She is a Peabody-award winning journalist, who also directed and wrote for Wait Wait Don't Tell Me and launched and then directed digital strategy at Fresh Air with Terry Gross. She started her career as a humor columnist for her college newspaper and frequently speaks at universities and conferences about building digital tools with and by users, and not for them.

After reading Eric Mill’s blog post about working in public, Melody knew she wanted to join 18F. 

“I was really attracted to the idea of working at an organization that strongly believes that good, forward-thinking work can be completed in the public sector — and is leading the charge to change the way the government builds and thinks about products or websites that millions of people interact with on a daily basis,” she says.
