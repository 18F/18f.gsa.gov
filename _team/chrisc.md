Chris is the director of 18F Consulting and has been around the federal technology space for a number of years. His specialities are vast and include digital and technology strategy, full stack development, product management, agile development, and agile acquisitions

Before joining 18F, Chris worked in a number of different business and technical environments, from creating startups to acquiring companies to jumpstarting innovation within the federal government as a Presidential Innovation Fellow.

"I couldn't imagine doing anything else. I think back to a speech I heard from Todd Park. He described impact as mass x velocity. If we can increase the velocity at which the government delivers innovation, imagine the public impact we can have. 18F is an incredible platform for driving innovative change throughout the government."
