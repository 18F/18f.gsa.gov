Jessie first became interested in politics in high school when she joined her local YMCA's chapter of Youth & Government. After graduating from Colby College, she worked on the 2008 Obama campaign in New Mexico, running the field office in the South Side of Santa Fe, and later interned for Senator Kennedy in Boston. But before long, she found herself missing the action-packed days of the campaign and ended up recapturing that energy by joining a startup in Cambridge.

From there, she went down the tech path and away from her political roots. She helped several start-ups with content, community management, and user growth and slowly moved over to the technical side. Her her first developer job was with the web development consultancy, thoughtbot. Through working with thoughtbot, she learned that the hardest part of software is not code - it's people! At thoughtbot, she worked with dozens of startups to write high-quality web applications that solve real problems.

At 18F, Jessie is joining her two passions: politics and technology. "Some people say that private sector tech companies don't care about changing the world," she says, "I've found that to be far from the truth. But what is true is that many changes can *only* come from within. During my time with 18F, I plan on being a big part of that within."

While she'll only be here for a few years, her goal is to make a lasting impact through delivering amazing software and best practices to other agencies within the federal government.
