Amanda has a BA in Government (American Politics) from Wesleyan University. That, and a reluctance to live in DC at the time, got her a job working for The Onion (yes, *that* The Onion). Eventually she decided to go back to school and earned an MS in Computer Science from New York University.

From there, she moved to the Bay Area and worked at Google in their Platforms Systems Software group and on [Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.org), helping to make USGS/NOAA satellite data more accessible and even analyzable. Just before 18F she worked for Indiegogo, as a developer building their tools for launching and contributing to crowdfunding campaigns.

"The first thing that attracted me to 18F was the potential to help so many people with the work that I do," Amanda says. "It's one thing to build tools for a small number of scientists or a few thousand fundraisers. It's entirely another to help the million people per year gaining immigration status."

For Amanda, 18F is a more diverse and idealistic group of people than she's had the honor to work with before and doing work open source is a huge draw, too. On the job she writes back-end code, works with data management and analysis and keeps software running fast. She's also comfortable with front-end development, building the parts of web-based tools that users see and interact with.

"I build tools to make US Government services not only work better, faster, and more efficiently," she says, "but also to make them more usable and accessible.
