Before joining 18F, Larry Bafundo worked in consulting, where he helped large organizations transition to agile and develop new digital products and services. Some of his work included leading a project to design the software architecture for Los Angeles County's new voting system, which may become the nation’s first open source voting system.

“I've always been someone who wants to work for more than just a paycheck - I want to help make the world a better place, even if just by a little,” Larry said. “There are so many talented people in the private sector doing amazing things for businesses, the public sector needs a few of them to help tackle some very big problems. 

“18F is the perfect place to apply that private sector experience for the purposes of helping government rethink how it does business and engages the American people in the digital age,” he said.
