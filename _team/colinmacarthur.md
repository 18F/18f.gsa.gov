Colin's specialty is user experience research. 

"That means I love talking to the people who use our products about what their goals are, what works for them and what doesn't," he says. "I'm particularly interested in lean UX, or ways to continuously test our assumptions about what our audience wants and needs."

Colin has a bachelor's degree in psychology from Carleton College. During college and afterwards, he worked for the National Park Service and started as a front-line interpretive ranger (talking to visitors, avoiding snakes, etc.) and grew into technology design, development, and planning positions at Bandelier National Monument and Acadia National Park. From there he went onto get his master's degree at UC Berkeley's School of Information Sciences and worked for 36 Views, a digital book design consultancy. 

"I love serving my country by working for the federal government, and 18F lets me do that using the best tools and techniques around. 18F is applying modern ways of designing and building technology to important government-wide problems â€” I can't think of any better place to use my skills in service to others!"
