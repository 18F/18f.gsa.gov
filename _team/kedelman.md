Kathryn is a member of 18F's consulting team, where she helps federal agencies use acquisition to better harness the power of agile development in order to deliver better technology faster and cheaper.

Before 18F, Kathryn spent the last eight years working in the government oversight community with a focus on acquisition issues, at the Government Accountability Office. While there, she lead performance audits of federal agencies and programs, and more recently in the Senate on both the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee. "I have focused on understanding and improving federal agency programs and operations through a diverse set of experiences, including assessing operations at Arlington National Cemetery, working with victims of Hurricane Sandy to understand their experiences with federal recovery programs, investigating fraud in the Social Security Disability Program, and working on the Federal Information Technology and Acquisition Reform Act to strengthen the role of federal Chief Information Officers and improve transparency into and performance of federal information technology investments," says Kathryn.

She holds a Master of Public Policy from George Mason University and a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service from Georgetown University.    

Why did she join 18F? "I believe in the value of public service and that technology is the critical enabler to almost everything the government does," she says. "18F brings together a unique and creative group of talented people trying new approaches to implement change. I'm here to get my hands dirty and contribute."
