Kaitlin is the Director of Engineering at 18F. She manages all of the developers at 18F, reviews incoming projects for their technical feasibility and is responsible for the strategic direction of the engineering team.

A self-described "procurement nerd," Kaitlin joined 18F from the Sunlight Foundation, where she worked as a Python/Django developer on projects like the Procurement Open Data Guidelines, the Sunlight API portal, and other data-intensive projects. She also spent two years at ESPN.com, where she honed her HTML/CSS/JS skills. She holds a B.S. in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Computer Science from The Johns Hopkins University.

"I spent five years at Sunlight, advocating from the outside-in," says Kaitlin. "At some point, I felt like I couldn't do much more without rolling up my sleeves and just getting to work actually fixing things. By opening up government data we are fulfilling goals of transparency and open government, but more importantly we're making it easier for other people in government to actually use that data."
