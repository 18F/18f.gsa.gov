Jen is a designer and user researcher who is currently working on a number of projects that will make immigration services more accessible. 

"I'm a designer who works on problems in the government space, which could mean anything from web design, to user interface design, to form design," she says. "I focus on trying to get all the great government content and services to work better for the people who need to use them."

After graduating from American University with a degree in graphic design, Jen worked at a small design studio before joining the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as a design and technology fellow.

"I work to make the government better and more efficient and more emphathetic," she says. "I really enjoy using my skills to make an impact and make peoples lives easier when they interact with government services."
