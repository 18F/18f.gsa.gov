With more than 25 years’ experience working in TV, radio, and digital media, Ori is no stranger to engaging viewers, listeners, and users in meaningful conversation. At 18F, he serves as a liaison between our project teams and the people who want to learn about our projects: Congress, the press, and the general public.

In addition to his television, radio, and digital media experience, Ori is skilled at creating audience-specific stories, especially on technical subjects.

Ori wants to show the world the great things government is capable of by creating and sharing 18F’s stories. 

"Using all the tools we have available — video, social media, live events, and some things that haven't been invented yet — we'll make sure everyone knows what we're up to," he says.
