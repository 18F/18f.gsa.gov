James is a back end developer with specialties in Android Application Development and DevOps. As he describes it, "Backend development is like the plumbing. It is out of sight but required. I work behind the scenes to develop the logic that interacts with other services and eventually returns what you see on the userâ€™s device."

James obtained a BS in Computer Engineering from the University of Virginia. After graduating, he started full time as a software engineer in the Rotation Engineer Program at Intel where he developed and demoed new software features ranging from embedded solutions to cloud services. After the rotation program, he joined Intel's Android team where he focused on developing new ways to optimize the Android user experience without compromising the performance. 

When asked why he wanted to work at 18F, he said "I wanted to be able to use my software development skills to have a greater impact. 18F is about bringing the best software practices to the government -- I wanted to contribute and be an agent of change in this effort."
