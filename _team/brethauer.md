A self-described “team design-process” nerd, Nick loves exploring and improving how our teams work, combining agile and lean methodologies to create an iterative process of team design, development, user research, and testing. 

"Most of the time I’m working in a product team doing user research and facilitating collaborative team design," he says. "I also spend some time in several working groups that are focused on building internal 18F practices and processes, like documentation, group building, outcomes and metrics, and project intake."

Before 18F, Nick spent two years working full time on a master’s in information management, where he studied information policy and human-computer interaction. He has also worked at NPR, the Sunlight Foundation, and as the creative director of an engineering company that pioneered the use of vehicle-based 3D LiDAR scanning and visualization.

"At 18F we are constantly learning from our projects and figuring out ways to scale successful processes and share them, which in turn provide benefits to more agencies, and the public," he says. "I loved the idea of getting to work on high-impact projects benefitting the public and getting to do so with a group of passionate, talented people."
