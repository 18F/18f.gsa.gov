Prior to coming to 18F Gail has enjoyed a wide range of experience across many industries including financial services, travel, healthcare, recruiting, and marketing. 

"I am incredibly lucky," says Gail. "After realizing my dream of a BFA degree in the lucrative fields of painting and printmaking, fate put me face-to-face with web 1.0 and put the tools to learn web design in my hands. I combined my passion for creativity and analytical thinking into a career designing with technology."

As a user experience designer, Gail works across fields and departments to facilitate collaborative design. As part of that process, she does user research and anchors products in knowledge and understanding of the people we serve. 

"That way we deliver more than technology. We deliver human solutions." 

Lastly, she is "devoted to the practice of bringing diverse minds together, to create exciting experiences, and solve business goals â€” with a little fun on the side. To that end I embrace agile methodologies when possible as well as lean UX when it's the right tool for the job."
