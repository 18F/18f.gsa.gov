Noah is a front end developer at 18F, where he’s currently working on a redesign of the Federal Election Commission’s website, making it easier to find and access data around the finances of our federal elections.

Before 18F, Noah worked in organizing in politics on projects designed to get people more involved with the civic world. He has also worked as a designer and developer, both for himself as well as for a small digital agency.

Noah deeply believes in bringing a user-centered, modern approach to building government software.  

“I want to design a fast, intuitive interface to make it easier for all types of users — experienced or novice — to understand the data the FEC provides,” he says.
