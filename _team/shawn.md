Shawn is a designer and programmer at 18F, where he works on interface design and development using a variety of programming languages and tools.

Shawn learned HTML 3.2 as a teenager and dropped out of art school when he was 18 to work as a web designer during the first dot-com boom. He has since worked in and on the web for over a decade, as an interaction designer, user-interface developer, and freelance web designer and developer. He has taught interaction design at Parsons School of Visual Arts in New York and GAFFTA in San Francisco.

"I've been a staunch advocate for information transparency and accessibility from my early days as a web designer," he says. "I've always been interested in open data, and the power of good design and technology to turn boring spreadsheets into useful information. And there's a serious opportunity for us to make people's lives better by making more data open and making it relevant to the public."
