Garren is the Director of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program. He was part of the founding effort at 18F, GSA’s innovative digital services delivery team, and has helped establish a program office and permanent home for the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program within that organization. His office works across the U.S. Government to recruit and deploy dozens of the country’s top innovators and civic-hackers on problems at the intersection of policy, product and technology--with the potential of saving lives, saving taxpayer money, creating jobs, or improving the way the Government serves its citizens.

As an entrepreneur, Garren has led multiple startup efforts, both independently and within large companies. As a management consultant, he leveraged similar “lean” thinking in redesigning business processes and technology solutions. Garren has contributed articles to VentureBeat and Huffington Post, and his startups have been covered by Entrepreneur, Forbes, TechCrunch, VentureBeat, and other publications. Garren holds a BA and MBA from Yale University.
