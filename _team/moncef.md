Moncef is a developer who loves automating tasks, helping people learn to code, and improving test coverage and QA. He's passionate about solving problems and giving back to the community and is currently working on projects related to immigration. 

"I help government agencies provide modern-looking and secure websites that are easy to use and address people's needs efficiently," he says.

A self-taught coder, Moncef joined 18F after a Code for America Fellowship, where he developed the [Ohana API](http://ohanapi.org/). He also spent 14 years at AOL, where he developed mobile apps. He holds degrees in electrical engineering and music from the University of Virginia and spends much of his free time designing tutorials that have helped thousands of people learn to code and turn their computers into [web development machines](https://github.com/18F/laptop).

Moncef decided to join 18F after his Code for America fellowship.

"I wanted something more meaningful than working on mobile apps that didn't really have a profound impact on society," he says. "I knew I wanted to stay in civic tech and work on things that matter and help the people who need it most."
