A member of our editorial team, Emileigh is an advocate of clarity, concision, and the Oxford comma. She’s been writing professionally since high school, when she started started stringing columns for her hometown's 20-page broadsheet. 

Over the past 15 years, she’s moved on to publish hundreds of newspaper articles in venues like CBS online and the Bakersfield Californian. Emileigh's a proud journalism alum of the University of Iowa, and she received her poetry MFA from the University of Mississippi and University of Plymouth. Her poetry has appeared in H-NGM-N, PANK, Sentence, and other journals. She's the author of two chapbooks.

Before 18F, Emileigh worked the agency’s near homophone: ATF.  She wrote everything from nationwide training programs to division policy. It was in that position she developed an addiction to plain language and government service. 

If not at work, Emileigh's probably watching reruns of West Wing, searching for D.C.'s best taco (hold the cilantro!), or hanging out at the dog park with her boxer, Huck Finn.
