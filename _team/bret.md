Bret is a product lead at 18F. He is currently working on cloud.gov, a platform that will consolidate multiple government agencies' IT operations activities in a single system that will improve the resiliency and security of agency applications. "My ambition is for cloud.gov is for it to act as a "force-multiplier" for the entire set of people working to improve government services, leaving them happier and more effective!" says Bret.

Before 18F, Bret worked at PlayStation, where he managed the developer services group and helped pioneer the use of web-based support for pro game developers. He had previously spent time in PlayStation's R&D group, where he worked on non-photorealistic rendering techniques for the PlayStation 2. Earlier in his career, Bret worked at LucasArts, where he was the lead programmer and assistant designer of Grim Fandango, a beloved 1998 LucasArts adventure game. He has a degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from the University of California at Berkeley.

Bret joined 18F because he wanted to make an impact. "While I enjoyed my time at PlayStation, the greatest impact that job could have on the world was to make it easier and cheaper to make console games," he says. "Meanwhile I have always campaigned for greater government transparency and action on major issues affecting US citizens, but I always had to do this in the margins of my professional and personal life, and as just one person in a crowd. 18F enables me to apply my experience and natural love of agile methods to root causes which directly impact the effectiveness of government... as my day job! That is a unique and special thing."
