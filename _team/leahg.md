Leah is the Operations Support Specialist at 18F. She manages the calendar for the Exacutive Director of 18F, arrange meetings and handle a variety of administrative processes. Her main project: keep things running smoothly.

 Right before I joined 18f, Leah worked for The Corporation for National and Community Service assisting with their internal auditing process. She studied Classical Studies (Ancient Greek and Roman History) at Earlham College.  Shortly after graduation, she joined Peace Corps  as a Community Health Volunteer in Ecuador where she spent her time time teaching health and art classes to children.

When asked why she wanted to work at 18F, Leah said "I love information and I want to make the world a better place.  Working at 18F allows me to combine my two passions by helping people gain better access to government services."
