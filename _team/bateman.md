Before he joined 18F, Patrick Bateman worked as a short order cook, caterer, registered lobbyist, landscaper, communications assistant, an intern of various kinds as well as a retail clerk, valet attendant, and a student. 

He holds  two degrees in political science (ask him about western political theory or the European Union), a law degree, and he’s a member of the Maryland bar.

What attracted him to 18F? He said it “seemed like a cool place that appreciated hard work.”

The languages and specialties he brings to 18F include “English, a tiny bit of Italian, basic Spanish” and he’s learning Python. 

“I can also code some mean HTML. And I am fairly decent at speaking federal budget and bureaucracy,” he said.

As Director of Operations, he manages “the team that makes it easier for the rest of the organization to do their work."

How does he view his role?

“Most of what I do is directing traffic and calming people down. I view it as very valuable work,” he said.
