John Donmoyer is a graduate of DePaul University where he studied network engineering and security. He was one of the first hires at YouEye, a user research analytics company, moving with the company to Mountain View, CA. Then he worked at Edmodo where he lead the design team that built products for millions of teachers and students around the world. 

The developer, who grew up in Gettysburg, PA, has worked in a number of startups, picking up a lot of different skills such as front-end web development to conducting the user research.

In January 2016, he returned to Chicago and joined 18F.

“When looking for my next job I knew I wanted to work with people that were passionate about improving the lives of others,” John said about why he joined 18F. “I also felt a sense of duty to spend some time serving my country in a way that would make the most use of my skill set. There's a lot of smart people working in the government and getting the chance to empower them with some of the techniques and technologies that I've learned after working in four different startups was an exciting opportunity.”
