Ric is the Director of Operations. "I joke that Team Operations does all the things no one else wants to do (finance/accounting, legal, contracting, business analytics, etc.), but all kidding aside - we help to create and maintain a foundation that allows our talented technologist to do what they do best, deliver. Our customers are our colleagues."  

With nearly 6 years of experience, Ric has been played crucial roles in shaping government. During this time, he worked with GSA's Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO) and the GSA Administrator to stand up GSA's revised Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) office. In August of 2013 I wanted a new challenge and was asked to help improve the Office of Strategic Innovation. 5 months later 18F was born. 

When asked why he wants to work at 18F, Ric answered in list form, "1) Big operational problems to solve (and we're no where near solving them yet), 2)Opportunity to work with an amazing group of driven, civic-minded people and 3) It sounded like fun."
