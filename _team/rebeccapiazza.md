To Rebecca, being a product manager means doing three things: working with our partner agencies to determine what problems they need to solve for their users, working with users to determine the best solution to address their problems, and leading a team to design and build the solution.

Rebecca has a degree in computer science from Tulane University and started out as a software developer.  Over the years, she moved into product management because for her, the exciting part of technology is building the right thing to solve a user's problem, rather than the technical mechanics of building it. 

She spent the first nine years traveling and living out of a suitcase as a technology consultant for state and local governments, building services that the public visit often, like sites to renew  driver's licenses and systems that help them file  taxes.  After that, she went into federal consulting, with a focus on projects to secure government networks against cyber threats.  

 Rebecca wanted to join 18F because "I wanted to go back to building things that directly impact people's lives and make government work better for them."
