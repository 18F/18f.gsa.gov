Josh is the director of product at 18F. In short, it's his job to ensure that product leads at 18F have what they need to do their jobs effectively.

Before coming to 18F, Josh worked as the software development lead at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and as a back end developer at the Sunlight Foundation.

"I joined the federal government four years ago to help create change from the inside," he says. "And I see 18F as one of the best shots at making that change happen."
