Theresa Summa is a front-end developer at 18F, where she codes web applications primarily for other agencies throughout the government.

Theresa joined 18F from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She has also worked on websites for media companies like The Economist and Quartz.

Theresa says she joined 18F because she feels transformative ways for technology to help people can start or happen in government. “I'm interested in 18F's model because more efficient and cost-effective project delivery leaves resources available for other work, improves the technology offerings of government and makes other work possible,” she says.
