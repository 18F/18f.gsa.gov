Theresa Summa is a full stack developer at 18F, where she codes web applications in JavaScript and Python. She has worked on a project for the Federal Election Commission to make federal election data easier to access and is currently working on a federal procurement tool, CALC.

Theresa joined 18F from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She has also worked on websites for media companies like The Economist and Quartz.

Theresa says she joined 18F because she feels transformative ways for technology to help people can start or happen in government. 

“I'm interested in 18F's model because more efficient and cost-effective project delivery improves the technology offerings of government, and makes other important work possible,” she says.
