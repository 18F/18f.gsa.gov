Meghana Khandekar, a designer at 18F, has expertise in varied fields — interaction and systems design, brand design, painting, and Hindi among them. She’s currently working on MyUSA, a service that offers comprehensive account management to government agencies and provides visitors single sign-on access to various government services.  

Meghana graduated from the School of Visual Arts' Interaction Design program in 2014. She has worked with startups, the Berkman Center, and UNICEF to design systems that improve access to and delivery of services. She’s especially excited about projects that engender the right to information, expression and privacy, and lead to increased civic and community engagement. 

When asked why she joined 18F, Meghana said, “I saw that 18F was doing the important work of making sure that government services and information are accessible to all. I just had to be a part of a team that exudes passion for its mission.”
