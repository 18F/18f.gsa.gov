Jamie was one of the first Operations Specialists to join 18F at a time when 
18F was still in its infancy; actually, we weren’t even 18F yet. Besides 
lacking a formal name, we were also light on staff — in terms of numbers, that 
is. At that time, we had just ten big-hearted problem solvers who believed 
they could transform government. Today she is a Talent Manager and helps 18F
hire all the fantastic people we need to keep making change in the government.

She is aso a marathon runner and speaks Arabic, French, and Spanish. Before 
joining 18F she was a PeaceCorps volunteer in rural El Salvador (RPCV El 
Salvador 2011-2013). Her focus there was in community development she came to 
18F because she's all about access. There are so many services that this 
country provides to its citizens (and non-citizens) but many can't figure out 
how to get them. If we have any impact making these services more available to 
the US's most vulnerable populations, she's happy.
