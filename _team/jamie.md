Jamie leads the hiring effort from the process and operations side of things. What does this mean? 

"I take the bureaucratic, challenging, weird, federal hiring process and make it better, faster, and more human," she says.

Before joining 18F, Jamie was a Peace Corps volunteer in rural El Salvador, where she focused on community development. "I bring the Peace Corps values of determination, flexibility, patience, and, above all, always have plan A, B, C, and D," she says.

She has also worked as a legal researcher at the Council of Islamic Relations, an apple herder at the Chinatown farmer's market, a paralegal at the Department of Justice, an operations coordinator at Teach for America, and a mailroom lady at the National Poison Center. She is also a marathon runner who speaks Arabic, French, and Spanish.

Jamie came to 18F because she is all about access. 

"There are so many services that this country provides to its citizens (and non-citizens) but many can't figure out how to get them," she says. "If we have any impact making these services more available to the U.S.'s most vulnerable populations, I'm happy."
