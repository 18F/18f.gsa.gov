Jamie is a Talent Manager and helps 18F hire all the fantastic people we need to keep making change in the government. 

She is also a marathon runner and speaks Arabic, French, and Spanish. Before joining 18F she was a PeaceCorps volunteer inrural El Salvador (RPCV El Salvador 2011-2013). Her focus there was in community development. 

She came to 18F because she is all about access. "There are so many services that this country provides to its citizens (and non-citizens) but many can't figure out how to get them," she says "If we have any impact making these services more available to the US's most vulnerable populations, I'm happy."
