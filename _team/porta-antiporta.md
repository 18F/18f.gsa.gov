Porta Antiporta has traveled through the "full stack" of software product delivery. He started as a software engineer with eventual stints in product management and strategy . He has a computer engineering degree from the University of Michigan and an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management.

Before joining 18F, he was the product owner of GoHealth's online health insurance marketplace that interfaces heavily with Healthcare.gov. 

As the son of a United Nations diplomat living in Italy, Porta saw the immense impact of public servants.  

"The U.N. provided me with opportunities seldom experienced by others. Working at 18F allows me to serve and pay back this debt, by making our government more accessible through tech," he said.

Going through the naturalization process to become a U.S. citizen, Porta experienced firsthand how non-user-centric design can hinder getting social services to those that need it the most.

He is currently the project lead for the redesign of the legal resources section of FEC.gov. The team is tasked with making those services more readily accessible and reducing barriers that make it difficult to navigate complex campaign finance regulations.
