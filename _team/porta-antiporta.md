Porta Antiporta started his career at Motorola as an embedded software engineer. He has also worked in product management and strategy. He has a computer engineering degree from the University of Michigan and a master’s degree in business administration from the Kellogg School of Management.

He has run the full gamut of software from being a developer to product strategy and definition.

Before joining 18F, he was the product owner of an online health insurance marketplace for GoHealth, a startup that interfaces heavily with Healthcare.gov. 

Porta, the son of a United Nations diplomat, said he was able to see the impact of public servants while growing up in Italy.

“I've always wanted to pay back the debt that I owe as the U.N. covered most of my undergraduate education,” he said.

A naturalized U.S. citizen, Porta said he has experienced “how non-user-centric design can hinder getting social services to those that need it the most.”

Working at 18F gives him the opportunity to “serve and give back to society by making our government more accessible through tech.”
