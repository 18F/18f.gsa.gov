Vraj Mohan has a background in consulting, software product and web application development, having held both development and management positions before joining 18F.

He has worked for companies such as NIIT in India, Cambridge Technology Partners, Evant (now a part of Manhattan Associates), MCA Solutions (now a part of PTC) and AWeber Communications.

“It is exciting that the best minds of our generation are being deployed toward the public good, rather than making the user click on that link,” Vraj said about working at 18F.

The developer, who has worked mostly with Python and Java technologies, looks forward to “writing open source for wider consumption and trimming waste in the public sector.”

The self-described lifelong student of the software engineering process said he is constantly looking for opportunities to improve his craft.

“I strive for simplicity and maintainability in the systems that I build,” Vraj said.
