While Britta was studying literature at the College of Creative Studies at UC Santa Barbara she worked for Yahoo! as the community manager for Delicious, a social bookmarking website that was part of early "Web 2.0." Just before coming to 18F she worked for Cydia, the alternative to the App Store for jailbroken iOS devices.

"I care about my work having an ethical purpose," Britta says. She wants her work to "make people's lives better, and not just people who have a lot of money, but people in general. Working for the federal government makes perfect sense for me since its mission is to serve the public."

18F gave her an onramp into public service by saying "yes, your tech industry skills are valued here - come help!" She wanted to work with people who are respectful, and saw that 18F puts a priority on this as well. "My secret is that in my previous jobs I answered tens of thousands of support questions from a wide variety of users, and I figured out many ways to solve frequent problems so that people didn't have to open so many support questions. This taught me all about effective writing, since I had a direct feedback loop telling me whether my documentation was working!"

She brings to 18F years of experience with technical writing and being part of open source project communities. As a content designer, she makes it easier for people to find the information they need, through content strategy, information architecture, writing, editing, and generally moving words around.
