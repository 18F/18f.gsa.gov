Before joining 18F, Carlo Costino worked as a senior software engineer at Bloomberg BNA, a small healthcare technology startup, and CACI, serving as a resource for the Library of Congress’s Office of Strategic Initiatives. He previously worked as a web developer at National Journal, Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and a small consulting firm.  He was also an adjunct professor at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), his alma mater, and currently serves as co-chapter leader for RIT’s D.C. alumni chapter.

The work we do at 18F and our mission were among the reasons he joined our team.

“18F exists to make things better in the government so that things are better for the public. This is noble, meaningful work, and I'd much rather spend my time and dedicate my knowledge and skills toward something of this nature,” he said. “In looking back on all of my previous jobs, I was the happiest and felt most accomplished/personally rewarded when working in places and/or on projects that were also geared toward this notion.”

He also said that he’s impressed with a culture of knowledge-sharing and trying new things.

“This is the opportunity of a lifetime, to be a part of something amazing while helping improve my country,” Carlo said.
As a full-stack developer and software engineer, Carlo has a broad range of expertise that includes web design, accessibility concerns, front-end development, and back-end development with a variety of languages and tools/frameworks.
