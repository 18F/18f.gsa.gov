Gray is the senior API strategist at 18F. He helps integrate digital services into federal agencies, with a focus on APIs and open source software. 

"I try to help agencies transition their workflows into something more modern and efficient, do more online, and further automate their workflows," he says.

Before 18F, Gray co-led the digital overhaul at the Federal Communications Commission, an effort that completely retooled the agencyâ€™s web presence. He also served on President Obama's Transition Team. Prior to that, he worked on the Obama presidential campaign and on the web team for Howard Dean's presidential campaign.

Gray joined 18F to make the government more efficient. 

"There's tremendous potential to any organization better integrating digital into its strategies and tactics," he says. "This is true in the government as much as anywhere else. 18F is working to move that forward."
