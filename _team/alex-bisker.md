Before joining 18F, Alex Bisker worked in digital marketing for large entertainment brands. She also produced and directed new theatrical productions.

“Coming from a background that had more Shakespeare than SQL, I also love working with folks who might not be super comfortable with technology, putting them at ease with the process and the tech while helping them find solutions that fit their user needs,” she said.

Alex is a product manager that sees her role as working with” project stakeholders and internal team members to deliver products that solve problems.”

She was drawn to 18F because “I wanted my work to have impact.”

“Seeing the scale of the problems 18F was tackling was really inspiring, and I knew I wanted to jump in and help make that happen,” she said.
