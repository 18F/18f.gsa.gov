The first countess at 18F (though not the first staff member to hail from England), Ada developed the first algorithm carried out by a machine. She looks forward to bringing insight to our government; among other projects, she'll be working to digitize paper processes.

In addition to her duties on the Engineering Team, the mathematician and writer will also play a leadership role on the Infrastructure Team. She'll be working out of the office of our friends in the UK at GDS.
