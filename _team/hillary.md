As the co-founder and deputy executive director, Hillary focuses on building the community, communications, and creative sides of 18F.

She previous served as a Presidential Innovation Fellow and worked for a company that helped build websites for federal, state, and local governments. She started her career working as a graphic designer on the state website of Arkansas.

"This is the place to get big things done. If you build something [in government] and it’s successful, it is going to touch an enormous amount of people,” she says. “And that’s intoxicating.”
