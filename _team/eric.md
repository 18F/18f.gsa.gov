Eric Mill is a full-stack developer, technologist and open source evangelist at 18F. He builds tools and websites, and frequently speaks with both the public and to fellow public servants about why 18F works the way it works. 
 
Eric came to 18F from the Sunlight Foundation, where he developed and then built models for how the government could work more openly. He also worked for a number of years as a software developer.

Eric deeply believes in making the government more open and transparent. “18F seemed like a special opportunity to help shape a team that has the license to try genuinely new things in a place where the only bottom line is improving the country,” he says.
