Becky is on the Engineering team at 18F, where she is working on a project to help improve the way the government publishes data about federal spending. Her background in database design, data warehousing, and data analysis — along with her Python skills — give her a strong toolkit to solve data mysteries large and small. 

Before 18F, Becky was the Director of Data and Technology at the National Priorities Project, a non-profit that tracks the federal budget. She has also developed and analyzed data for companies in health care, higher ed, and the utility space.

Becky joined 18F because it was the work she advocated for in her most recent job. “The project I work on (DATA Act) is, frankly, one of the most important things happening in the government,” she says. “Currently, the data we have about federal spending comes from different systems, and it doesn't tie together into one, comprehensive picture of where our tax dollars go. The DATA Act was passed last year to fix that, and it's an honor to help with its implementation. This impacts every single person in the country.”
