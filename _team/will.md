- 18F Intake
---

Will is building the infrastructure for project intake at 18F. 

In his words: "My job is to figure out the most effective ways 18F can continue to do good work and grow. I look at everything from the projects we choose to take on to how we position ourselves within GSA and the USDS family. I touch all projects coming into delivery but also help across the board with documentation, onboarding, and other projects."

Before 18F, Will worked at an electronic medical records company, where he built infrastructure, managed support, and helped hospitals install and configure enterprise-level software. He holds a bachelor's degree in political economy from Williams College, where he was an [accomplished bell ringer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Lh9IwmifXs) and singer. Will is a self-taught programmer and actively helps others at 18F learn code and how to use the software we use.

"I am altruistically motivated - I like giving my creations away for free and working for the government allows me to do that by default," he says. "Also, I think this work is incredibly important, and I think that I'm well matched to it as someone that's able to navigate technology as well as bureaucracy."
