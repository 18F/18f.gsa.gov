Will Slack provides managerial support for 18F's Products and Platforms and helps interested federal partners learn about 18F's offerings in the business line. In addition, he directs work on the Federalist platform.

Before 18F, Will worked at an electronic medical records company, where he built infrastructure, managed support, and helped hospitals install and configure enterprise-level software. He holds a bachelor's degree in political economy from Williams College, where he was an [accomplished bell ringer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Lh9IwmifXs) and singer. Will is a self-taught programmer and actively helps others at 18F learn code and how to use the software we use.

"I am altruistically motivated - I like giving my creations away for free and working for the government allows me to do that by default," he says. "Also, I think this work is incredibly important, and I think that I'm well matched to it as someone that's able to navigate technology as well as bureaucracy."
