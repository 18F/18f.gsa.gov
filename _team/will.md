- 18F Intake
---

Will manages project intake at 18F. 

In his words: "My job is to help 18F continue to take on great projects as we grow by managing how we represent 18F to potential partners and then represent those possible projects to 18F. I also look at everything from our competiting priorities to how we position ourselves within GSA and the wider Digital Coalition. Besides facilitating intake, I help across the board with bureaucracy hacking, documentation, and other projects."

Before 18F, Will worked at an electronic medical records company, where he built infrastructure, managed support, and helped hospitals install and configure enterprise-level software. He holds a bachelor's degree in political economy from Williams College, where he was an [accomplished bell ringer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Lh9IwmifXs) and singer. Will is a self-taught programmer and actively helps others at 18F learn code and how to use the software we use.

"I am altruistically motivated - I like giving my creations away for free and working for the government allows me to do that by default," he says. "Also, I think this work is incredibly important, and I think that I'm well matched to it as someone that's able to navigate technology as well as bureaucracy."
