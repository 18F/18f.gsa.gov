Alla Goldman Seiffert has always been passionate about the intersection of technology and public service. Before joining 18F, she worked as a national security communications consultant at a government contracting firm. She is now a member of our Consulting Acquisitions team working on projects such as micro-purchase and the agile BPA.

Her love of all things tech and government drove her to complete internships at different federal agencies including the Department of State, the Executive Office of the President, U.S. Coast Guard, DHS, DOJ, and the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. Alla holds a law degree from the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law.

Prior to law school, she worked as a digital strategist at a website development firm in Washington, D.C., and as an intelligence analyst at the Department of Defense.

“18F is like no other pace in the federal government,” she said. “I am very excited to work for an organizations whose mission and code of conduct I deeply identify with.”

She said her “languages” include the ability to read and interpret laws, regulations, and policies. She’s also a fluent Russian linguist.
