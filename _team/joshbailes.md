Josh serves as the lead on all 18F interagency agreements and internal acquisitions. Largely this involves contracts, agreements, or an memorandum of understanding. 

"I make the agreements/acquisitions process smooth for the development team to ensure they have the tools and agreements in place to do their outstanding work. I'm here to help."

Prior to 18F, Josh has been a minister, a non-profit program director, and a content specialist. Along the way, he got a law degree, created content for web and print publications assisting victims of crime, and helped create systems inside and outside the federal government to improve processes and increase transparency. 

"I'm an attorney who believes agile methodology can and does change the way systems interact with people," he says. "18F offered me the opportunity to be part of changing the way government does government. The people at 18F are talented and willing to push the boundaries in order to make government digital services focused on the needs of citizen users. That's exciting and worthwhile."
