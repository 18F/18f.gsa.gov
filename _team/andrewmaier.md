Andrew is a designer and user researcher by trade but describes his role at 18F more broadly. 

"I enjoy everything from project management and policy/governance to user research, interaction design, and front end development," he says. "Basically, I enjoy everything related to software development that doesn't involve a database â€” especially the human bits."

Andrew comes to 18F from the Code for America fellowship program, where he worked with the state of Rhode Island on educational projects. Before that, he developed his wireframing and coding skills as the lead interaction designer at a startup, developed 11 applications simultaneously for an agile development consulting firm, and cofounded a small publication to discuss best practices related to user-centered design. He holds a bachelor's degree in discrete mathematics from Georgia Tech University.

"Working at 18F allows me to channel everything I've learned in the private sector over the past seven years for public benefit," he says. "Many designers in private sector put a great deal of emphasis on personal brand: becoming a rockstar, ninja, etc. Designers in the public put much more emphasis on prudence: creating things that help make other people more effective. The people at 18F care a great deal about not only solving problems but solving them in a way that's sustainable."
