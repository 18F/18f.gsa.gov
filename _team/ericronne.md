Eric is a visual designer at 18F. He most recently designed the website for Michelle Obama and the Peace Corps' "Let Girls Learn" campaign. In his words: "I help make government websites that are as professional, pleasant and intuitive as those found anywhere else on the web."

Before 18F, Eric worked in digital for a large ad agency and created visual campaigns for a wide variety of clients. He says that a "government that is of, by and for the people, should be people-friendly and people-centered. I want to help make that a daily reality."

Eric joined 18F because of the people. "I’m collaborative to the core, and love the spark which results when bright, dedicated people band together for Good," he says. "And to me, that’s 18F in a nutshell.""
