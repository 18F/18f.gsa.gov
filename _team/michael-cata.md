Before joining 18F, Michael Cata worked as a management consultant helping large companies create the space and structure needed to build new technology.  The Ohio State University graduate has a love of all things stats and economics. He loves to quantify fuzzy problems and push the "big picture" in real, functioning code.

“The United States welcomed my father and grandparents with open arms after Cuba fell to Castro,” he said. “They lived the American dream, raised three doctors and a successful businessman. The other side of my family worked everywhere between the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and local courthouses to education nonprofits and community college boards. I had a fantastic experience at a land-grant, research university and strong community leaders growing up.”

On why he joined 18F, Cata said he has a lot to give back to the United States. “18F presented the perfect opportunity to combine my duty for public service with my passion for studying large institutions,” he said.

He wants to help federal agencies “build organizations that build the right product.”

“That means creating the space for developers to work with policy experts and finding solutions that bridge existing services with the latest tools,” Cata said.
