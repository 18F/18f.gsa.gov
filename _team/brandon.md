Brandon came to 18F in the midst of a career sorting out the complexities of intellectual property and electronic media. He worked for record labels, telecom, airlines, and even dabbled in marketing automation. (Sorry about the email!) He came to 18F after learning more about the opportunity to make a positive difference in how the government serves people. "I want to move the needle and generate a sustainable improvement for society."

His development experience is primary in building web applications with Java connected to various databases and integrations. Combined that with some frontend skill, "I can build a web interface, connect it to services, and design where the data need to be." Beyond writing the applications, he enjoys helping early-stage companies and projects thrive and deliver quality products.

On the 18F Consulting team he is here to help our partner agencies achieve their mission goals effectively, transparently, and iteratively. Since starting in August, he has worked with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Transportation Safety Administration, and the Department of Labor, and worked with 18F to automate the interagency agreement process we use to work with our partner agencies.
