Aidan Feldman is a developer at 18F, where his weapons of choice are usually Ruby and JavaScript. Aidan uses those tools to build web applications for federal agencies, work on internal tools and documentation, and promote open source, collaboration and communication. “An interesting thing about working in the public sector is that, unlike working at a product company, people generally don't have a choice but to use the thing you build,” he says. “Therefore, the goal is not increasing engagement or selling more widgets, but enabling the users to get the information or task done with as little frustration and hassle as possible.”

Before 18F, Aidan worked as a full-stack developer at a variety of companies, including Jux, Artsy, GitHub, and Food and Wine. He’s also taught coding at the Flatiron School, the City University of New York, NYU, and Hacker Hours. He double majored in Computer Science and Dance at the University of Michigan, and routinely dances in New York City, where he lives. 

Aidan says he joined 18F because he was looking for an organization that is as passionate about open source as he is. “I can’t think of many opportunities with as enormous of potential impact as ‘changing how the federal government does technology,’” he says.
