He has written software with diverse impacts, including encouraging kids to visit our federal lands and waters, making federal regulations easier to read, studying human health behavior using Twitter, facilitating document management for insurance companies, and helping people go on vacation. He has a master's in computer science from the University of Iowa and two bachelor's degrees from the University of Texas, one in computer sciences, one in mathematics.
