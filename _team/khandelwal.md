Shashank Khandelwal is a software developer at 18F, where he codes primarily in Python. Among other projects, he has worked on creating the new openFOIA site and loved being part of this initiative — as he puts it, “everyone should have open and useful access to government records.”

Just prior to joining 18F, Shashank worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He has written software with diverse impacts, including making federal regulations easier to read, studying human health behavior using Twitter, facilitating document management for insurance companies, and helping people go on vacation. He has a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Iowa, and a BS in Computer Sciences and a BA in Mathematics from the University of Texas.

Shashank came to 18F “to help make technology-related changes across the federal government instead of just at one agency.”
