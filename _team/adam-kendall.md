Adam Kendall started working in system operations and network security for a few Fortune 500 companies before he transitioned to a full stack developer. 

He has a bachelor of fine arts, “so I really can work the whole stack, from designing the user interface down to the installation and maintenance of the operating system,” he said.

For the past 15 years, he had worked for a government contractor, using agile practices in software development to target user needs as efficiently as possible.

“I came to 18F because there are few opportunities for change as a contractor. Your customer defines the way you work and deliver the product,” Adam said. “Working within the system, and especially within 18F, I felt that I could have a greater impact on how software is produced and delivered within the government.”

He’s comfortable in several areas, from Python to JavaScript, and config files to command lines, a sort of jack of all trades mentality that allows him “to help pitch in where needed, as needed.”

“Traditionally, there has been a disconnect or even perceived barriers between developers and operations people,” Adam said. “Developers may know how to build the software, but not how to get it deployed. Operations folks know how to get the software running, but not how to troubleshoot a problem if something goes wrong. The need to bridge this gap, with people who understand both sides of the equation, and can smooth the rough edges between the two is typically known as DevOps. Given my background in both, this has been the natural fit for my skills.”
