Steven Reilly's professional life started in law. He had stints at National Public Radio's Office of General Counsel and the U.S. Copyright Office before serving as a law clerk for a federal judge at the Court of Federal Claims.

"While I was lawyering during the day, I started attending Code for DC meetups, where I began to learn to code," he said. "The premise of civic hacking—finding creative solutions to community problems, often with technology—was eye opening to me, and had important lessons about the way that laws and policies are created."

He believes in the "the power of technology to bridge the gap between the public and the government that serves them."

Steven said he was drawn to 18F because of the people and the openness of our products.

"There is so much knowledge and skill on the 18F team, and that creates exciting possibilities for solving problems and puzzles," he said. "And making ourselves accountable publicly sets a great example and helps create a foundation for this work to spread beyond ourselves."

At 18F, he is a member of the acquisitions team, hacking both code and Code. His role is to "find ways to improve the legally-required workflow with technology."
