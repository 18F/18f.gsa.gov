Zac is on the consulting team, and that's where he fights for users and to get them involved "waaaay earlier" than most. 

"I want to keep them involved throughout the whole process. I want to make sure people get their REAL problems solved," he says.

Before 18F, Zac was employee #7 at Startup Weekend, helped Nordstrom build their Innovation Lab, and started a consulting company to help the State of Washington learn about customer development, lean startup, design thinking, and liberating structures. While in Seattle, he started and ran the Hacker News Seattle Meetup, the Customer Development Meetup, and was an organizer for Ignite: Seattle. 

When asked why he joined the team he points to the potential for impact.

"I'd been helping the State of Washington and saw what I could do there, but the chance to work at the federal level, from the inside, means the amount of people I canÂ help is 100 times," he said.
