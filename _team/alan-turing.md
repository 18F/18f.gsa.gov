A computer science pioneer, Alan Turing is one of the fathers of computer science. He's on temporary detail to 18F from our friends in the UK's Government Digital Service. We're excited to have him join us for this short engagement, where he will be focusing on improving our testing practices.

Due to other commitments, Mr. Turing will only be working for the team on April 1st.
