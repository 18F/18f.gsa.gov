Kate Garklavs is a content designer and strategist at 18F. Working closely with usability researchers and other designers, she helps project teams define their communication frameworks and plan their long-range content goals, and creates succinct, impactful copy centered on reader needs.

A longtime lover of language, Kate earned her MFA in fiction writing from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Before joining 18F, she designed online fine arts coursework and oversaw writer-focused editorial and education strategy for a startup.

In each of her projects, Kateâ€™s goal is to present her subject in an accurate, striking, and detailed manner using the cleanest possible language. An advocate of plain language, she was drawn to 18F by the prospect of simplifying written resources across government.
