Jacob is a backend developer. He especially likes working with data that is difficult to understand – like most government databases – and figuring out how to make it easy and simple for the public to comsume. "I do a lot of data modeling and high-level architecting of how sites should work."

Jacob is a native Washingtonian before leaving for Boston to earn a combined B.A./M.Eng. in Computer Science from MIT. Proir to 18F, Jacob worked at the New York Times, where he helped form a team of developers in the newsroom working on news-related projects. In 2012, he moved back to DC and worked remotely on covering several elections and other projects. 


"I work for the public. Working in data journalism, it was very clear to me how important a role data played in helping journalists and the public to understand what their government is doing. I want my work at 18F to contribute to that, by sharing data that was once hard to find and making simple processes that were once complex."
