Jacob is a back end developer. He especially likes working with data that's difficult to understand – like many government databases – and figuring out how to make it easy and simple for the public to comsume. 

"I love to do data modeling and high-level architecting of how sites should work," he says.

Jacob is a native Washingtonian who earned a combined bachelor's and master's degree in computer science from MIT. Prior to 18F, Jacob worked at the _New York Times_, where he helped found a team of developers within the newsroom. In 2012, he moved back to D.C. and worked remotely for several years before joining 18F.

"I work for the public. Working in data journalism, it was very clear to me how important data is for journalists and the public to understand what their government is doing," he says. "I want my work at 18F to contribute to that by sharing data that was once hard to find and making transparent government processes that are now obscure."
