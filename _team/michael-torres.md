Before joining 18F, Michael Torres worked as an engineer, a designer, and a director of product development as well as a director of product and a UX visual designer. He has experience managing engineering and product teams as well as running products.

“I’ve been primarily doing product work for the last six years, and I have a good deal of experience moving enterprise software projects from waterfall to agile,” he said.

Michael came to 18F to help do the same with government IT.

He said that healthcare.gov was a preventable disaster if “only the right methods and tools had been used. So I’m here out of a sense of desire to make government IT things better for the people.”

He works on tools to help 18F “create and maintain a culture of collaboration and innovation.”
