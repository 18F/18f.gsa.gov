Lindsay is a developer at 18F. She is currently working with the Federal Election Commission to create a user-centered website powered by the FEC's first API.

Lindsay spent the last five years at the Sunlight Foundation, a transparency nonprofit in the D.C. area. She was involved in everything from reporting and organizing Sunlightâ€™s annual TransparencyCamp to building websites using disclosure data.  

A strong advocate for open data, Lindsay says she enjoys working with the FEC because the project "combines my love for making data-driven web apps with my passion for disclosure."
