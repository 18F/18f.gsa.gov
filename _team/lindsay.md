Lindsay is a developer at 18F. She is currently working with the Federal Election Commission to create a user-centered website powered by the [FEC's first API](https://github.com/18F/openFEC).

Lindsay spent the last 5 years at the Sunlight Foundation, a transparency non-profit in the DC area. She was involved in everything from reporting and organizing Sunlightâ€™s annual TransparencyCamp to building websites using disclosure data.  

A strong advocate for open data, Lindsay says she enjoys working with the FEC because the project "combines my love for making data driven web apps with my passion for disclosure."
