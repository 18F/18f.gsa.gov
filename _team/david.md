David is a project manager and front-end web developer at 18F. In his words: "This means I get to wear a lot of hats; I run user research interviews, manage client relations, write code, and generally help the rest of the team be awesome.	Working with the government shouldn't be hard, especially for small businesses."

Before 18F, David did a lot of different types of software development - from database driven applications to embedded operating systems to GPS satellite simulations. He also led the first Startup Weekend in Dayton, OH and currently captains Code for Dayton, the local Code for America Brigade. He received a BS in Computer Science from Wright State University in 2005.

David joined 18F because, as he put it, "Who wouldn't?"

"So many people complain about government being broken. Why not try and fix it?" he says. "Especially if given the opportunity to work with this many talented and passionate people."
