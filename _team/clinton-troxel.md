Clint Troxel joined 18F after working years in startups in Boston and then in Jackson, Wyo.

“I was tired of the start-up-follows-the-$$-rat-race,” Clint said about why he joined the federal workforce. “Pursuing good, for people is so much better.”

Clint, who grew up in Indiana, has a bachelor of arts degree in computer science (with a minor in interpersonal communication) from DePauw University in 2001. He then worked in Jackson with a software company, and later he worked self-employed, consulting and making lots of smaller apps.

“Previous to 18F I wore 100 hats at a couple different software startups.  I love simplicity, helping people, playing in the outdoors, making music, and my not-quite-2-year-old daughter Sage,” Clint said.
