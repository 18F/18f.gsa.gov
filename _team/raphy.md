Raphy is a product manager who helps build web-based tools for government workers. 

"I help guide what we build and how we build it," he says.

Raphy came to 18F after serving as a Presidential Innovation Fellow. He has also worked as a user interface designer, a software developer, and a project manager for a variety of consulting, entertainment, and startup companies.

"In government tech, small wins at scale imply enormous impact," he says. "Every 18F project has this potential, which is a reminder to me that we build products that can ultimately improve people's lives."
