Holly is the Director of Engineering at 18F. She is passionate about building amazing teams and helping engineers succeed in their careers. 

Before 18F, Holly worked at PLOS, a non-profit open access scientific publisher, where she led the software department and helped introduce agile methods. She also spent eight years at DreamWorks Animation, where she wrote software, led teams, and managed programs that transformed how movies were made. 

Holly points to two reasons she joined 18F: the work and the people who work at 18F. "For years my career has been bending toward using my time to make the world a better place," says Holly. "When I heard about the work 18F is doing, I knew I had to be part of it because this work really matters. I was also drawn to the caliber of people I get to work with here. My fellow 18F employees are some of the most talented and accomplished colleagues I've ever had."
