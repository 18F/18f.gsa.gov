Holly is a product lead at 18F. In her words, "My goal is to help our partner agencies, engineers, and designers work together efficiently and effectively to deliver impactful services for the users."

Before 18F, Holly worked at PLOS, a non-profit open access scientific publisher, where she helped introduce agile methods. She also spent eight years at DreamWorks Animation, where she wrote software, led teams, and managed programs that transformed how movies were made. She has also worked in the medical startup space and as a mechanical engineer for Stirling Engines. She holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering from MIT.

Holly points to two reasons she joined 18F: the work and the people who work at 18F. "For years my career has been bending toward using my time to make the world a better place," says Holly. "When I heard about the work 18F is doing, I knew I had to be part of it because the work 18F is doing really matters. I was also drawn to the caliber of people I get to work with on a daily basis. My fellow 18F employees are some of the most talented and accomplished colleagues I've ever had."
