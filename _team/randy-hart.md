Randy is a procurement specialist. He joined the government in 2002 and worked as a contracting officer for the Census Bureau and the Navy. As a "level 3" officer, he was trained to compete and negotiate contracts worth more than $100 million. "I've bought everything from software and hardware to large integrated systems," he said of his work before 18F.

He was attracted to 18F for the opportunity to reform the procurement system through experimentation and doing something about a complicated system long overdue for change. "The idea of developing innovative tools and methodologies that actually give Contracting Officers the resources to make better deals, with a new breed of vendors, is extremely appealing."

Randy specializes in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and finding innovative ways for the government to buy things. At 18F he hopes to "find agile ways of contracting," that would make it unnecessary to be dependent on a single contractor, bring new vendors into the market, and make the entire process easier on the hard-working federal employees responsible for spending taxpayer money.
