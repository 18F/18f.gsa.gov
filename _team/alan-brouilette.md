After handing over the first resume they'd ever seen with an e-mail address on it, Alan Brouilette spent eight years at ABC and ESPN Radio as "that kid who understands the Internet." 

He left to build an Ameriprise franchise in Key West, which consumed the next eight years. After that, he wrote comedy and magazine articles, taught, and took short-term gigs while he sought the next long-term thing. 

What drew him to 18F was “the magnitude of the challenge.”

“I'm a sucker for impossible odds,” he said. “This gig is the Battle of Thermopylae and we're the Spartans. Irresistible.”

His special skills include possessing a “black belt in people skills and a knack for moving things forward.”

How would he describe his 18F job to someone who doesn’t work in the government?   

"You ever work with an engineer that was unbelievably brilliant, like next-level genius, but whom it was always better to keep away from clients and nontechnical staff? I'm the other end of that spectrum,” Alan said. 

How does he view the projects he’s working on?

“As an intricate series of Gordian Knots to cut,” Alan said.
