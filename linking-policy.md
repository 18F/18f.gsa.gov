We include links to information created and maintained by other public and private organizations. 18F provides these links and pointers solely for our visitors' information and convenience. When you click a link to an outside website, you are leaving the [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) site and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the owners/sponsors of the outside website. We are not responsible for the content or privacy policy of an outside website. Non-federal websites do not necessarily operate under the same laws, regulations, and policies as federal websites.

We choose links consistent with sound public policy and that support the mission of 18F, GSA, and its programs.  18F regularly reviews the quality and usefulness of the sites it links to. However, we do not control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness of information contained on a linked website. As of the date we linked to any outside website, it was a site that was consistent with this policy.

Because the websites of other government websites must follow the same governmentwide policies that 18F does, links to these sites (including the U.S. military) are made without notification or disclaimer.

All links and pointers to sites that are not part of the government are identified as "nongovernment links". The current list of nongovernment links on our site can be found [here](https://github.com/18F/18F.gsa.gov).

The inclusion of links is not intended to assign importance to those sites or to the information contained on those sites. It is also not intended to endorse or recommend any views expressed or products or services offered on these sites. We link to other websites and refer to commercial products or enterprises solely for your convenience and education. Links to commercial sites must avoid even the perception of favoritism or bias relative to other similar commercial sites. If other sites exist which offer similar products, information, or services there must be a link to all sites or none.

18F is not responsible for transmissions visitors receive from linked websites. 18F also does not guarantee that outside websites comply with Section 508 (Accessibility Requirements) of the Rehabilitation Act.

18F will not link to any website that exhibits hate, bias, or discrimination. Furthermore, 18F reserves the right to deny or remove any link that contains misleading information or unsubstantiated claims, or is determined to be in conflict with GSAâ€™s mission or policies.
