18F works in partnership with agencies across government on a reimbursable basis, delivering public-facing services via web applications, data and service Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and platforms. 18F operates using three basic models:

*For you:*	Building solutions for an agency
*With you:*	Integrating with an agency team to provide additional expertise or core capacity
*By you:*	Advising an agency on how to build or buy user-centric digital services most effectively 
 
18F is an [open source team](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy). It uses open source development to transparently promote  the security, quality, and modularity of our code and to invite review, participation, and free and simple reuse of our efforts by government agencies, the business community, and developers.
