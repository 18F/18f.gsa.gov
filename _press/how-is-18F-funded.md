18F is a cost-recoverable organization. We rely mostly on the following two channels for funding our work.

* GSA funds 18F through the [Acquisition Services Fund][1] (ASF), which allows for investment in the development and delivery of products and tools that will be used by other agencies on a reimbursable basis.

* The Economy Act allows 18F to be reimbursed for services provided to other agencies. Once an agreement is in place, we bill on a quarterly basis through [IPACS][2].
