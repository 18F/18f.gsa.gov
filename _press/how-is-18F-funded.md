* GSA funds 18F through the [Acquisition Services Fund](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/182815) (ASF), which allows for investment in the development and delivery of products and tools that will be used by other agencies on a reimbursable basis.

* [Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows) are being provided to agencies on a reimbursable basis through an Economy Act transfer. The cost of 18Fâ€™s client services work is being recovered in the same manner.
