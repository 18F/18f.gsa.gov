[18F Delivery](/delivery) is the larger of our current service offerings. It's a collection of teams comprised of designers, developers, and product managers that work _for_ and _with_ other federal teams at agencies like the Federal Election Commission, the General Services Administration, and the Department of the Treasury ([among many others](https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard/)) where we build tools to improve government services.

[18F Consulting](https://18f.gsa.gov/consulting/) helps agencies acquire better software by providing design thinking and technical acumen on a short-term, as-needed basis or as part of an extended project. The team offers a variety of services from knowledgeable and experienced software engineers and acquisition specialists.
