It is a collection of teams comprised of designers, developers, and product managers that work _for_ and _with_ other federal teams at agencies like the Federal Election Commission, the General Services Administration, and the Treasury ([among many others](https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard/)) where they build tools to improve government services.
