We publish our code repositories [on GitHub](https://github.com/18F) and encourage the public to adapt our code and [guides](https://pages.18f.gov/guides/) for their own projects.

Here are some examples of how our projects have been adapted by others:

* Several governments have used/adapted the code that powers [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov):
    * [City of Boulder](https://bouldercolorado.gov/stats)
    * [City of Philadelphia](http://analytics.phila.gov/)
    * [City of Sacramento](http://analytics.cityofsacramento.org/)
    * [City of Santa Monica](http://analytics.smgov.net/)
    * [Municipality of Anchorage](http://analytics.muni.org/)
    * [Tennessee Department of Environment & Conservation](http://analytics.tdec.tn.gov/)
* The District of Columbia adapted [18F's Guides Template](https://pages.18f.gov/guides-template/) into [their own](http://dcgov.github.io/guides-template/), which they are using for things like the [DC Government Open Source Guidelines](http://dcgov.github.io/open-source-guidelines/).
* Lovely, a real estate startup, created [their documentation platform](http://hub.livelovely.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) by adapting [the code created](https://github.com/18F/hub) for 18F's Hub. The Hub helps 18F organize our information and explore the connections between team members, projects, and skill sets. It serves as the go-to place for all team information.
* [Pulse](https://pulse.cio.gov/) was forked to check [German](https://https.jetzt/) and [Norwegian](https://https-norge.byeskille.no/) government domains for HTTPS.
* [Many sites](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/wiki/Websites-that-use-the-Draft-U.S.-Web-Design-Standards) have adopted the [Draft U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/).
