We publish our code repositories [on GitHub](https://github.com/18F) and encourage the public to adapt our code and [guides](https://pages.18f.gov/guides/) for their own projects.

Here are some examples of how our projects have been adapted by others:

* The City of Philadelphia's [analytics dashboard](http://analytics.phila.gov/) uses [code](https://github.com/18f/analytics-reporter) that was developed by the [Digital Analytics Program](https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/) and built largely by 18F.

* Lovely, a real estate startup, created [their documentation platform](http://hub.livelovely.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) by adapting [the code created](https://github.com/18F/hub) for 18F's Hub. The Hub helps 18F organize our information and explore the connections between team members, projects, and skill sets. It serves as the go-to place for all team information.
