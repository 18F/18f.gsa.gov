* GSA launched 18F on March 19, 2014. The name is an abbreviation for GSA’s address — 1800 F St.

* The 18F team started with 15 full time staff. Staffing has grown to over 180 as of May 2016, as 18F’s product and client work has increased.

* Our goal was (and is) to transform the way the U.S. government approaches problems. Read more about our evolution in the blog posts from our [first](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/20/one-year-in-and-looking-forward/) and [second](https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/second-anniversary/) anniversaries.
