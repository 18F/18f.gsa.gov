* GSA launched 18F on March 19, 2014. The name is an abbreviation for GSA’s address — 1800 F St.

* The 18F team started with 15 full time staff. Our team has grown to over 100 as of January 2015, as 18F’s product and client work has increased.

* Our goal was (and is) to transform the way the U.S. government approaches problems. You can [read more about our first year on our blog](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/20/one-year-in-and-looking-forward/).
