### MyUSCIS

We helped the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) launch [myUSCIS](https://my.uscis.gov), a platform that allows users to easily access information about the immigration process and find immigration options for which they may qualify. Re-imagining the immigration process meant moving from a form-centric website to a human-centric one. We worked closely with USCIS across multiple disciplines to create a suite of resources and tools to demystify the naturalization process, move application forms online, and design an improved account system for applicants.

### BetaFEC

The [Federal Election Commission (FEC)](https://beta.fec.gov) has long been a pioneer of open data, but 18F was able to help the FEC build its first public API, and a new website on top of that API. This site helps make campaign finance information more accessible to the public, as part of a larger redesign of the FEC’s online presence. [Read more about the site and why we’ve released it as a beta](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/29/welcome-to-betafec/).

### College Scorecard

The [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) site is an example of what 18F can do to help your agency provide an interactive, well-designed way for the public to access your data. We worked with the U.S. Digital Service and the Department of Education to build College Scorecard to give students and their families access to previously unreleased data about colleges and universities so they can make better decisions. The site is built on top of a public API, which also allows private individuals and companies to use the data.

### Draft U.S. Web Design Standards

![A screenshot of standards.usa.gov]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/projects/draft-us-web-design-standards.png)

In collaboration with the U.S. Digital Service, we created [a collection of design patterns and user interface toolkits](https://standards.usa.gov) to help agencies focus on building their website or application without reinventing trustable, accessible solutions to common government problems. The draft web standards includes typography and color recommendations that are compliant with [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (the federal standard for accessibility)](http://www.section508.gov/), as well as a collection of foundational interface elements for government sites and the code that powers them. We have blogged about [our work on these standards several times](https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/web-design-standards/).

### Analytics.usa.gov

![A screenshot of the analytics.usa.gov homepage.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/projects/analytics-usa-gov.png)

You can now view a [dashboard of analytics data](https://analytics.usa.gov) from the websites of agencies participating in GSA's Digital Analytics Program. The basic dashboard has three views: one showing how many people are on government websites _right now_; the other two show the most popular pages on government sites in the last seven and 30 days. In 2016 we added agency specific pages to the dashboard, allowing users to see the same data for several departments as well as across the entire government. This open source project has been [adapted for use in other city and state governments](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/01/06/tips-for-adapting-analytics-usa-gov/).

### Cloud.gov

![A screenshot of the cloud.gov homepage]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/projects/cloud-gov.png)

[cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov) includes a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) specifically built for government, based on the open source Cloud Foundry. It provides a secure, scalable platform for teams to build and host their application or website. It can help development teams work faster and cheaper by handling much of their deployment complexity. The cloud.gov platform is currently in a small pilot program, but we will be expanding access over time.


### Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division Field Operations Handbook

In two days, our consulting team was able to work with a team at the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division to take the four-volume, printed Field Operations Handbook and create an internal prototype of an online, searchable version. We were also able to demonstrate the power of using agile design and development methods.

### Health and Human Services, State of California, Code for America, RFP Ghostwriting

![The California, Code for America, and 18F team after the workshop.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/blog/ca-child-welfare/ca-team.jpg)

We partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services, the State of California, and Code for America [to draft a request for proposal (RFP) to fix the state's child welfare case management system](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/03/22/helping-california-buy-a-new-child-welfare-system/). This system is used by more than 20,000 social workers to track and manage the more than 500,000 cases of child abuse and neglect that are reported in California each year. 18F's two-day RFP ghostwriting workshop got stakeholders on board with modular contracting and modern development methodologies, and helped the state trim their initial 1,500 page RFP into two 70-page documents.

### Every Kid in a Park

In collaboration with the U.S. Department of the Interior, The White House, and other federal agencies, 18F build [a site to help U.S. fourth graders obtain their free pass to national lands and waters](https://everykidinapark.gov) and is [specially designed to be used by kids](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/03/every-kid-in-a-park/).

### U.S. Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (U.S. EITI)

After holding a design studio for the Department of the Interior's Office of Natural Resource Revenues, 18F was able to build the first iteration of the U.S. implementation of a global project to bring transparency into natural resource management and the money paid to the government on public land leased to private companies. In preparation for [Interior's first EITI report](https://useiti.doi.gov), the team continued to iterate and test their product with users across the United States. [We've written about this project several times on the 18F blog](https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/useiti/).

### CALC and Discovery

In two of our first projects, 18F worked with Federal Acquisition Service employees to create [market research tools](https://discovery.gsa.gov/) to help write better contracts and [find better vendors](https://calc.gsa.gov/) to include in blanket purchase agreements. [CALC is currently being used by the City of Boston](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/11/10/boston-is-using-gsa-calc-tool/).
