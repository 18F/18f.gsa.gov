* [Beta launched FBOpen](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/03/31/announcing-fbopen-government-opportunities-made-easier/), an API and search tool which helps small businesses find opportunities to work with the U.S. government.

* [Launched NotAlone.gov](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/05/09/a-few-notes-on-notalone-gov/) in partnership with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Office of the Vice President. NotAlone.gov helps students and school administrators find resources on responding to and preventing sexual assault.

* [Launched Communicart](https://speakerdeck.com/18f/cap-communicart-18f-demo-day-9-may-2014), a simplified, email-based purchasing approval tool for purchase card holders authorized to buy office supplies for the government.

* Developed the strongest [open source policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy) in the US government, setting a clear expectation to the outside and to our team that [we work in public](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/31/working-in-public-from-day-1/), and leading to a [GSA-wide “open source first” policy](http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/innovation/2014/08/01/our-guiding-principles/).

* Piloted [Midas](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/16/midas-a-marketplace-for-innovation-in-government/) at the Department of Health and Human Services and the State Department. The “crowdwork” platform is now powering GSA’s microtasking platform, [Open Opportunities](https://midas.18f.us/).

* Alpha launched [Discovery](https://discovery.gsa.gov/), a market research tool for the OASIS procurement vehicle.

* Doubled the size of the [api.data.gov](https://api.data.gov/) program, with 13 APIs across seven agencies now using the shared service.

* Hit a [/Developer Program](https://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/) milestone of engagement with more than 100 API teams, providing training and direct support to help agencies build out web services and engage the developer community.

* Worked with the Digital Analytics Program and the White House to build [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/), a public dashboard for the US government’s web traffic.

* Developed a clear [HTTPS-only standard](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/11/13/why-we-use-https-in-every-gov-website-we-make/) for 18F’s work, [helped several agencies](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/02/09/the-first-gov-domains-hardcoded-into-your-browser-as-all-https/) meet the same standard, and [supported the development of a government-wide HTTPS-only policy](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/17/for-public-comment-the-https-only-standard/).
