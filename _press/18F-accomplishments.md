### MyUSCIS

We worked with the U.S. Digital Service to move the [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)](https://my.uscis.gov) from a form-centric website to a human-centric one. This includes work across numerous disciplines to create a suite of resources and tools to demystify the naturalization process, move application forms online, and design an improved account system for applicants.

### BetaFEC

The [Federal Election Commission (FEC)](https://beta.fec.gov) has long been a pioneer of open data, but 18F was able to help the FEC build its first public API, and a new site on top of that API. This site will help make campaign finance information more accessible to the public, as part of a larger redesign of the FEC’s online presence. Read more about the site and why we’ve released it as a beta.

### College Scorecard

The [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) site is an example of what 18F can do to help your agency provide an interactive, well-designed way for the public to access your data. We worked with the U.S. Digital Service and the Department of Education to build College Scorecard to give students and their families access to previously unreleased data about colleges and universities so they can make better decisions. The site is built on top of a public API, which also allows private individuals and companies to use the data. Read more about the College Scorecard project.

### Draft U.S. Web Design Standards

[A collection of design patterns and user interface toolkits](https://standards.usa.gov) to help agencies focus on building their website or application without reinventing trustable, accessible solutions to common government problems. The draft web standards includes typography and color recommendations that are compliant with [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (the federal standard for accessibility)](http://www.section508.gov/), flexible, and designed for readability and impact as well as a collection of foundational interface elements for government sites and the code that powers them. We have blogged about [our work on these standards several times on 18f.gsa.gov](https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/web-design-standards/).

### Analytics.usa.gov

A [dashboard of analytics data](https://analytics.usa.gov) from the websites of agencies participating in the Digital Analytics Program. The basic dashboard has three views: One showing how many people are on government websites _right now_, the other two show the most popular pages on government sites in the last seven and 30 days. In 2016 we added agency specific pages to the dashboard, allowing users to see the same data for several departments as well as across the entire government.

### Cloud.gov

[cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov) includes a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) specifically built for government, based on the open source Cloud Foundry. It provides a secure, scalable platform for teams to build and host their application or website. It can help development teams work faster and cheaper by handling much of their deployment complexity. The cloud.gov platform is currently in a small pilot program, but we will be expanding access over time.

### Every Kid in a Park

In collaboration with the U.S. Department of the Interior, The White House, and other federal agencies, 18F build [a site to help U.S. fourth graders obtain their free pass to national lands and waters](https://everykidinapark.gov) and is [specially designed to be used by kids](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/03/every-kid-in-a-park/).

### U.S. Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (U.S. EITI)

After holding a design studio for the Department of the Interior's Office of Natural Resource Revenues, 18F was able to build the first iteration of the U.S. implementation of a global project to bring transparency into natural resource management and the money paid to the government on public land leased to private companies. In preparation for [Interior's first EITI report](https://useiti.doi.gov), the team continued to iterate and test their product with users across the United States. [18F has written about this project several times on the 18F blog](https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/useiti/).

### CALC and discovery

Two of our oldest projects, 18F worked with Federal Acquisition Service employees to create [market research tools](https://discovery.gsa.gov/) to help write better contracts and [find better vendors](https://calc.gsa.gov/) to include in blanket purchase agreements. [CALC is currently being used by the City of Boston](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/11/10/boston-is-using-gsa-calc-tool/).
