## Hypotheses tested

This was our first major round of research that focused on the new 18F website.

We believe that: the new 18F site, with a new focus on potential partners as its core audience,
will result in: increased interest from federal agencies, and project leads.

## Participants

* 2 people who are members of the tech community who are fairly familiar with the 18F website.
* 2 people who are federal employees moderately familiar with 18F because of recent chats with business units.
* Each person we talked to had relatively high digital literacy and/or moderate subject-matter knowledge: one works in data science in the private sector, one works for a state government on accessibility issues, and two are federal employees at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

## Methodology

We showed each participant the 18F website, and asked them to navigate the page and familiarize themselves with the information while thinking out loud.

## Findings

### Overall findings

Here's what we noticed:

* We talked to two different audiences in this round of research, and they had noticeable differences in their behaviors on the 18f website.
* Testers in the tech community are more familiar with "how we work," namely our guides, and come to the 18F website to use them in their own work.
* Testers in the federal government are less familiar with "how we work," and some of the more technical jargon.
* Testers in the federal government focus more on "what we deliver," and the next steps to hire 18F.
* Testers in both groups look for a list of projects.


#### Overall usability

- Three out of fours users hard difficulty getting back to the homepage from some of the pages and or guides.
- "What we deliver We Help seems like a run on sentence."
- For those in the tech community, both users looked for and couldn't find shareable code or GitHub right away.
- Link to the playbook is a little long.
- None of the users clicked the links in the hero.
- One user mentioned an expectation of a search box on guides pages.


### Specific feedback

#### Tech Community Employees:

- Come to the site for guides, standards, definitions, open-source code, and resources to use at their companies.

Quotes:

> "I’m always having to define accessibility for people. Might be nice to have that glossary available of special terms."
> "How do I hack how you’re doing it and bring that back to my company?"
> "Not doing anything to show that links go to external site. That’s interesting to me."


#### Unclear terms

- Some terms were unclear:
    + "Code of Conduct."
    + "You probably have international audience, and not everyone knows what NC is."
    + "You do have a content guide, which is probably same as style."

### Overall positive feedback

- "Tags on the blog posts."
- "The official website of US government is good -- feel like I am in a safe place."
- "Website banner and 18F logo line up!"
- "Guides, really love the layout."
- Like “here’s how you enact change” culture and tech, really like that because I work at large org now.
- "Everything is very clean."
- "Plain language."

#### Federal Employees in Partner Agencies:

- Heard about 18F from colleagues and from friends and partners of 18F.
- Want to know more about how we fit in and work with other parts of GSA.
- Want to know more about next steps if and when they want to hire 18F.
    + If I want to hire you, what authority do i have to email this group? Is there a phone number to call?
    + Who else in my agency should I reach out to at the same time?
    + People could email this without working with the CIO?
    + Do I have enough money to work with 18F?
    + Do I have the right kind of project suitable for 18F?
- Want to know more about the names and faces of 18F.
    + Who receives the email when I write to the inquiries box?
    + Could you add an org chart or a note from the Executive Director?

Quotes:

> "One more thing I thought about regarding your website/approach to get more federal clients. In the simplest terms, I think there are two groups of people that know about 18F right now: 1) executives who are told this is the latest thing and they should be participating and 2) tech-minded people, who are mostly junior in their agencies, but understand the value and have been asking why the govt doesn't do this already. Your website is focused on the first group as well as other managers with known problems, but maybe there are resources to add that attract the second group, motivate them to get their projects to those executives, and get them excited about what a tech-forward government could look like. You have all of the information, but it needs the excitement of opportunity."
> "I liked in the old site the big bold letters that said you're building 21st century digital government - told me exactly what you do."
> "You offer way more than I realized."
> "I'd expect you to have the best website ever."

#### Unclear terms

- Some terms were unclear:
    + "What does modern digital service techniques mean?"
    + "What does the path to become a digitally powerful organization mean?"
    + The "how we work" section is not what I expected and it's a little out of my wheel-house, but it's interesting.

### Overall positive feedback

- "Very cute picture on the home page."
- "Examples and links to projects are really helpful."
- "I love the icons on the homepage."


## Conclusions

In addition to looking into some of the usability comments, we should make sure it's easy for potential federal partners to understand the work that we do and how we might work with them by eliminating some of the more technical jargon, and identifying gaps in the "hire us" section.

In the next phase of the research, we recommend doing some content testing if possible.
