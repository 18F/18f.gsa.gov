## Background

We launched the new 18F website in August. This is the first round of research where we focused on testing the usability of the site. 

## Participants

* 2 people who are members of the tech community who are fairly familiar with the 18F website.
* 2 people who are federal employees moderately familiar with 18F because of recent chats with business units.
* Each person we talked to had relatively high digital literacy and/or moderate subject-matter knowledge: one works in data science in the private sector, one works for a state government on accessibility issues, and two are federal employees at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

## Methodology

We showed each participant the 18F website, and asked them to navigate the page and familiarize themselves with the information while thinking out loud.

## Findings

### Overall findings

We talked to two different audiences in this round of research, and they had noticeable differences in their behaviors on the 18f website.

* Testers in the tech community are more familiar with "how we work," namely our guides, and come to the 18F website to use them in their own work.
* Testers in the federal government are less familiar with "how we work," and some of the more technical jargon.
* Testers in the federal government focus more on "what we deliver," and the next steps to hire 18F.
* Testers in both groups look for a list of projects.


#### General feedback

- Three out of four users hard difficulty getting back to the homepage from some of the pages and or guides.
- "_What we deliver We Help_ seems like a run on sentence."
- Users were expecting separate links to human-centered design, agile methodologies, and open source software. They were surprised that it was all one link to the playbook on the "how we work" page.
- None of the users clicked the links in the hero. (Hero is currently photo of cute celebrating the Every Kid in a Park project)
- One user expected to see a search box on the guides pages.

### Audience specific feedback

#### Tech community:

Both members of the tech community came to the site for guides, standards, definitions, open-source code, and resources to use at their companies. Both users also looked for and couldn't find shareable code or GitHub right away.

Quotes:

> "I’m always having to define accessibility for people. Might be nice to have that glossary available of special terms."
>
> "How do I hack how you’re doing it and bring that back to my company?"
>
> "Not doing anything to show that links go to external site. That’s interesting to me."


#### Unclear terms for members of the tech community

+ "Code of Conduct."
+ "You probably have an international audience, and not everyone knows what NC is." [North Carolina]
+ "You do have a content guide, which is probably same as style."

#### Positive feedback from members of the tech community

- "Tags on the blog posts."

### Federal employees in partner agencies:

- Heard about 18F from colleagues and from friends and partners of 18F.
- Want to know more about how we fit in and work with other parts of GSA.
- Want to know more about next steps if and when they want to hire 18F.
    + "If I want to hire you, what authority do I have to email this group? Is there a phone number to call?"
    + "Who else in my agency should I reach out to at the same time?"
    + "People could email this without working with the CIO?"
    + "Do I have enough money to work with 18F?"

Quotes:

> "One more thing I thought about regarding your website/approach to get more federal clients. In the simplest terms, I think there are two groups of people that know about 18F right now: 1) executives who are told this is the latest thing and they should be participating and 2) tech-minded people, who are mostly junior in their agencies, but understand the value and have been asking why the government doesn't do this already. Your website is focused on the first group as well as other managers with known problems, but maybe there are resources to add that attract the second group, motivate them to get their projects to those executives, and get them excited about what a tech-forward government could look like. You have all of the information, but it needs the excitement of opportunity."

> "I liked in the old site the big bold letters that said you're building 21st century digital government - told me exactly what you do."
>
> "You offer way more than I realized."
>
> "I'd expect you to have the best website ever."

#### Unclear terms for federal partners

+ "What does _modern digital service techniques_ mean?" (On the homepage under "What we deliver")
+ "What does the _path to become a digitally powerful organization_ mean?" (On the homepage under "What we deliver")
+ The "how we work" section is not what I expected and it's a little out of my wheel-house, but it's interesting.

#### Positive feedback from federal partners

- "Very cute picture on the home page." (Picture refers to a photograph of children celebrating Every Kid in a Park)
- "Examples and links to projects are really helpful."
- "I love the icons on the homepage." (Icons refer to the bottom of the homepage under "What we deliver")


## Conclusions

We should make sure it's easy for potential federal partners to understand the work that we do and how we might work with them by eliminating some of the more technical jargon.
