# Sprint-FestiveFjord research results

This sprint, we did two main types of research: user interviews, in which we asked people to explore the site while talking through their responses, and content testing, which pulled content out-of-context and asked users to highlight confusing (or clarifying!) phrases. See the [full research plan](festivefjord-research-plan.md), [interview script](festivefjord-interview-script.md), and [content testing script]() for details and methodology.

## Background

Our hope in this sprint was to get more clarity about which parts of the website were confusing users, and which — if any — were helping them understand 18F.

## Participants

For overall usability testing, we talked to:

- 3 U.S. government employees, all military (2 Air Force, 1 Coast Guard)
- 1 Canadian government employee
- All had some level of familiarity with either 18F or technology and acquisitions innovation work

For content testing: We did 3 content-testing sessions with GSA PBS employees in San Francisco. All 3 had heard of 18F, but were otherwise unfamiliar with what we do.

## Results

### Findings: Overall usability and major questions



### Findings: Confusing words and phrases

In all 3 sessions, participants used only the orange highlighter. (This may be because it is much less instictive to meta-cognate about things that _do_ make sense; future test designs should adjust for this possibility.)

These sessions focused on testing 2 pages of content, including the current homepage copy and several new paragraphs being considered to describe 18F.

One participant expressed frustration about the number of things mentioned: “Why not just put ‘what is 18F’ or ‘who we are’? You’re trying to go too many directions!”

The terms participants highlighted as confusing included:

`platforms` (3)

- “I’m not sure what a platform is, unless you can build it with steel and wood.”

`cultural change` (2)

- What is “cultural change”?
- “What are you getting at here?”

`modern` (2)

- “Modern...that’s unclear to me”

`legacy modernization`

- “I don’t know what legacy modernization means”

`IT spend` (2)

- “I’ve never heard this term.”

`often guarantee that their projects are delayed, over-budget, and/or unable to meet their customers’ needs`

- “I had to read that, like, ten times.”

`API` (came up a couple times in both kinds of testing)

`digitally-powered`, `digital service`, `digital service techniques` (2)

Highlighted at least once:

- `Delivery is the strategy`, `What we deliver`
- `custom products`
- `standard government procedures`
- `cloud hosting`
- `bringing your data and services into the 21st century`
- `partner agencies`

### What's working

Information about wasted $90 billion:

This catches my attention! This is nice.
Put it up front — how will 18F help deliver that value? I want to know that.
