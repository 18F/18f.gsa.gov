# Sprint-FestiveFjord research results

This sprint, we did two main types of research: user interviews, in which we asked people to explore the site while talking through their responses, and content testing, which pulled content out-of-context and asked users to highlight confusing (or clarifying!) phrases. See the [full research plan](festivefjord-research-plan.md), [interview script](festivefjord-interview-script.md), and [content testing script]() for details and methodology.

## Background
