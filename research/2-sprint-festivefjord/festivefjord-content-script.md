# Sprint Festive-Fjord content testing script

## Setup

* GSA mobile device for recording conversation, and/or research partner to take detailed notes
* [Content testing document (limited access)]()
* Orange and green highlighters (or whatever colors you can come up with)

## Introductory comments

Brief introduction – share your name and a description of what you’re working on (making our website make more sense to colleagues in the federal government).

Very brief discussion of the purpose of today’s test: “My goal today is to get feedback on the words we’re using to talk about ourselves. I’m talking to people to see what makes sense and what’s confusing. All feedback is anonymous, and the test should take less than 10 minutes of your time.”

“Please remember when I say ‘test’ I mean I’m testing our website and if it is clear or not. There are no wrong answers for you!”

**Recording:** Do you mind if I record this session? _Explain that recording will be for research purposes only, and will not be shared outside of project team._

## Main section

Ask: **What’s your job? What do you do within GSA?**

Ask: **Have you heard of 18F before? What do you know about 18F?**

_Show the participant the print-out of the site content, hand them two colors of highlighters, and ask them to read through the content and highlight it according to what makes sense and what doesn’t._

As they work through the pages: Ask follow-up questions as necessary, encourage them to follow their own process (i.e. it’s fine for them to do one read-through before they start highlighting), and respond to any questions with further discussion.

## Wrap-up

“Thank you so much for your time. Do you have any questions for me?”
