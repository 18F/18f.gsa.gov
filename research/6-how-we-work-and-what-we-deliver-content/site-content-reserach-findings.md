# What we were researching

-   Do agencies understand the content and context of the “What we deliver” section on the site
-   What project pages resonate with agencies
-   How do agencies reach out to us from the site
-   Do agencies understand the content on the “How we work” page, and does it provide the necessary information for them to understand our services.

# Major Observations and themes

## What We Deliver

**1. The term “what we deliver” is easy for federal/state visitors to understand**

The majority of participants (6/10) agree the current name is appropriate for the content on the page and they are familiar with the term. They understand the page will include examples of our work. Even those who recommended other names (What we do/done, offerings, projects, and working across government) had no major issues with the current name, and only did because they were prompt to do so.

**Recommendations**

The findings contradict the [hypothesis](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/blob/research/research/6-how-we-work-and-what-we-deliver-content/site-content-research-plan.md), which called for a new name. Therefore, no changes are necessary.

**2. The content of the “what we deliver” page meets federal/state visitor expectations, but they wish all project pages had an image.**

When asked where on the site participants would go to find examples of our work, the majority chose the “what we deliver” section. Most expected to find a list of our services and case studies. They liked how the project pages were organized in two sections (services and products), and contained short descriptions and images.

> "Yeah, it’s pretty cool. I didn’t even know you guys did all that stuff." - NARA employee

In addition, participants were mostly attracted to projects related to their personal interests as well as those containing images. They wished there were no place holders on projects missing cover images.

> "The ones that have pictures are really sticking out. I’d rather go to the ones that have a visual and look interesting. The ones with temporary pictures, I wouldn’t go to those first." - GSA Acquisition Gateway

Also, project pages were hard to recognize since the name of the project is not clearly mentioned upfront. Others preferred that services were further categorized into themes such as data, strategy, acquisitions, and design.

**Recommendations**

The content of “What we deliver” meets all expectations overall, but some improvements could include:

-   Design or gather images for all project pages.
-   Include the name of the projects either as a subtitle or in the description.
-   Reevaluate categories for project pages.

**3. Visitors don’t expect to find information on past partnerships in this section.**

When asked where on the site participants could go to learn about past partnerships, most were unsure. Only 2 mentioned “What we deliver”. Another popular answer was the “About” section (4/10). Still, after looking through the “What we deliver” page, participants were happy to find the list of agencies. But they wished it was visible sooner without having to scroll further down the page.

**Recommendations:**

Include the “Some agencies we’ve worked with” section on the homepage for better visibility

## How we work

**1. Content of how we work section is not clear to federal/state visitors**

When asked what do they expect to find in the “How we work section”, most participants thought it would include information on one of these categories:

-   Organizational information: Our office makeup, org chart, skills of our staff, and directory.
-   Partnership information: Timeline of partnering with 18F, costs, past partnerships, steps to engage with us.
-   Methodologies: Agile, UX, working in the open, and other content similar to the partnership principles

Even though some of the content on the page does touch on these topics, it’s not the sole purpose of this section. Most participants were hoping to find information on the cost and the process of partnering with 18F. Those who were looking for organizational information were glad to find some in the “About” section, but still wanted more information on our structure (Front office, chapters, etc.)

**Recommendations:**

-   Include a timeline, preferably a graph, on the 18F partnership process.
-   Reinstate that we are open to work with other agencies for a fee
-   Link to partnership principles from the “How we work” page
-   Reevaluate including more information about 18F’s organizational structure in the about section.

**2. Content on how we work is too dense, and does not provide the information they need.**

Most visitors believed the content on the “How we work” page does not provide them with enough information to reach out to 18F. The amount of text and the organization of the page makes it hard to read, and most would gloss over the content. In addition, the page still lacks pricing information, and contains acronyms that are not familiar to them (COTS).

For those who were not overwhelmed and read through the Path Analysis section, the page was still not persuasive enough. They could infer the goal of a Path Analysis, but not how they could benefit from it or if it’s right for their project. Also, they’d like at least an estimate of the cost.

> "Most people would like to jump toward building something. I wonder how persuasive it is to do this [Path Analysis]. Talk about the benefits of doing it and what problems it can solve." - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau employee

**Recommendations**

As mentioned in the [*hypothesis*](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/blob/research/research/6-how-we-work-and-what-we-deliver-content/site-content-research-plan.md),the current information on the page is too much for visitors to digest and still doesn’t provide the information federal/state visitors are looking for. Therefore, the content can be improved by doing the following:

-   Decrease the amount of text by creating graphics that explain the process or breaking down the text using bullet points.
-   Mention benefits and provide examples of previous Path Analyses and experiment & iterate projects.
-   Include a cost estimate for path analysis.

**3. Testimonials emphasize our value and trust.**

Participants felt more confident about 18F after reading the testimonial included in this page. It ensures them we are trustworthy and efficient.

> "I like the testimonial right away. Shows that someone who partnered with you was successful in their project." - General Services Administration/Acquisition Gateway employee

**Recommendations**

Add more testimonials throughout the site (not only ones hidden behind project pages).

## Contacting 18F

**1. Having a variety of ways to contact 18F makes it easier for agencies to reach out to us**

When asked how will they contact 18F from different pages on the site, participants clicked on the option that was easier to them at the time--not the one they already knew. For example, a participant who previously clicked on the contact button in the navigation bar might also use the email linked on the “How we work” page. None of the participants had any issue finding how to get in contact with 18F.

**Recommendations**

The use of multiple forms of contact buttons and links throughout the site has proven successful. No changes are necessary.
