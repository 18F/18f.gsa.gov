# How We Work and What We Deliver content research plan

After conducting nomenclature research on the last sprint and updating
the content of the how we work page, we decided we want to learn how the
updates resonate with federal employees. We especially want to know the
following: Do visitors know what to expect under the “What we deliver”
page, and does “How we work” provides a clear understanding of 18F’s
services and process.

## Study 1

### **Hypothesis**

When federal visitors to the site see the “What we deliver” section they
might not understand the context and content of the page. We believe
that a more plain language title, like “What we do” will be easier for
federal employees to understand. This will increase views of the project
pages.

### **Method**

To test this hypothesis we’ll conduct a 30min usability test and
interview session. We’ll ask users to show/tell us the following:

-   From the menu bar, where would you go to find examples of our work?
-   From the menu bar, where would you go to learn about our past partnerships?
-   What do you expect to find under the “what we deliver” section?
-   Please go to the “what we deliver” section, is the content what you expected? How is it different”?
-   Have you heard about these projects before?
-   Did any of them catch your attention? Why?
-   If you could rename this section, what name would you give it?
-   Will this information influence your decision to reach out to 18F?
-   If you were to reach out to us how would you do it from this page?

***Participants and recruiting***

Participants will be 5-15 federal employees from various agencies. For
recruitment, we’ll reach out to 18F staff and our network for a list of
possible contacts willing to participate. Then, we’ll reach out to them
to schedule a 30min interview.

***Recruitment email***

Hello :NAME:,

My name is ___ , and I'm with the Outreach team at 18F. We’re
conducting research to improve our site, so it’s more accessible and
provides the information agencies need. Would you be willing to help us
by participating in a brief feedback session? If you have the time, we’d
love to schedule 30 minutes to get your feedback as you explore the 18F
website.

We’re available at the following times (all Eastern Time):

-   :DATE:
-   :DATE:

If you’re interested but not available at these times, just let me know
what would be convenient for you. We’re looking to gather feedback by __

Thank you so much for your willingness to help, and I look forward to
talking with you.


## Study 2

### **Hypothesis**

We believe that the new content in the “How we work” page provides the
necessary information for our visitors to understand our services (path
analysis and experiment/iterate) and the value it can provide to their
projects. This will increase the number of emails inquiring about the
services in this page.

In addition, we believe the current amount of information is too much
for visitors to digest. In usability testing, interviewees will become
distracted and unable to finish the content before providing feedback.

### **Method**

To test this hypothesis we’ll conduct a 30min usability test and
interview session (Same session as study 1). We’ll ask users to
show/tell us the following:

-   From the menu bar, where would you go to learn more about 18F’s services?
-   What do you expect to find under the “how we work” section?
-   Please go to the “how we work” section, is the content what you expected? How is it different?
-   After reading this section, can you tell me the goal of a path analysis?
-   How could a project at your agency benefit from a path analysis?
-   Does this page give you enough information to decide whether to contact 18F about working together? Is it too much or not enough?
-   Will this information influence your decision to reach out to 18F?
-   If you were to reach out to us how would you do it from this page?

***Participants and recruiting***

Participants will be 5-15 federal employees from various agencies. For
recruitment, we’ll reach out to 18F staff and our network for a list of
possible contacts willing to participate. Then, we’ll reach out to them
to schedule a 30min interview. We’ll use the same participants as in
Study 1.
