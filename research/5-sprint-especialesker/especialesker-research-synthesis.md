# Sprint-EspecialEsker research results

This mini-round of research saw us talking to three people. We were hoping to validate whether some of our changes are working, and whether people are figuring out what 18F does more quickly.

## Background

We talked to three people. Two of them were more interested in learning from 18F practices than hiring 18F, and both of those users gravitated quickly toward the blog or guides.

## Findings

A number of things we had in-progress were further validated by this round of research:

- One user asked what the name "18F" means, and said he might expect to find that on an "About" page, if there was one (there was not, at that time).
- Project pages did seem to help one user bridge the gap to understanding how we might help their agency.
- Two users were confused by "Hire" and "Join" in the navigation, which we've since fixed.
- Two users expressed mixed feelings about the image on the homepage (with sticky notes), but did seem to grasp quickly that it was a picture of a workshop or brainstorming session.

Some things seem to be working well:

- Once people got to the "Hire" page, they expressed confidence about next steps.
- People seemed to quickly head to the "What we deliver" section to learn more about projects.
- All users seemed to understand that 18F charges other agencies to do work.

### Other observations

Users got trapped in the guides or partnership playbook, because there was no clear way to get back to the core 18F site.

Two users expressed a desire to read more about _how_ we work, particularly how we do acquisitions or deal with challenges in projects.

One user struggled to understand what kind of work we do, and seemed to look for _services_ rather than _problem statements_:

> it wasn’t clear and obvious to me what service was being offered...I don't see a connection between what our agency is doing and the services that are being provided...is it one service or many services?

## Recommendations

We decided to wrap up this round of research because we wanted to get in-progress changes launched before doing further testing.

The primary recommendations from this round of research:

1. **Move crucial content — namely intake content — into the 18F site, to avoid losing users in the handoff to guides.**
2. **Add a link back to the 18F site in the base guides template, so that users can find their way back to our primary site after exploring.**
