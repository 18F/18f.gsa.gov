# Sprint-EspecialEsker research plan

We've changed the homepage and Hire 18F pages to address some of the past research results, and it's time to figure out if it worked!

## Goals & questions

Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Are people figuring out what we do faster? | How would you describe what 18F is and what they do?
Do the three types of problems help people understand our work? Are our example projects helping people picture how they'd work with us? | What kinds of projects would you want 18F’s help on?
 | What would you want to know before working with 18F?
Is the Hire 18F page clearer and more inviting to potential partners? | What would you do on this page?
 | What concerns would you have about working with 18F?

## Methods

This research sprint will focus on overall usability testing to see how the site functions as a whole. You'll need:

* 3-5 30 min interviews with federal employees at other agencies (or within GSA), all of whom should be somewhat unfamiliar with 18F
* A notetaker and notes document for each interview
* In-person or remote
* https://18f.gsa.gov/

We’ll work with 18F Agency Partnerships and friends of 18F to find contacts at other agencies.
