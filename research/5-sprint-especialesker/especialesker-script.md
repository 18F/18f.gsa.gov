## 30 Minute video interview

### Equipment / login (5 min)

### Intro (5 min)

Hi there! Thanks for agreeing to talk to me — I really appreciate it. My name is [X] and I’m joined by my colleagues [X]. We work for 18F, and we’re working on improving our website.

Your participation is totally voluntary, and you’re free to end the interview at any time. The most important thing to keep in mind is that this isn't a test, and you're the expert — for the next half-hour, you can't be wrong.

We'd like to take detailed notes, so we can share our findings with the rest of the team, but we won't attach your name to our synthesis. Is that okay with you?

Do you have any questions?

Okay! Let’s get started.

First, could you tell me a little about what you do? What's your job at your agency?

And how did you learn about 18F?

## Site walkthrough (15 min)

[If hangouts]

- Have you shared your screen on google hangouts before? Okay, you might want to close anything on your screen you don’t want me to see. [walk them through screen sharing]

Okay, please go to 18f.gsa.gov. Let me know when you see the site.

[If no hangouts, remind them to think out loud and tell you what they're looking at]

Take a minute to look through this site while thinking out loud.

**Let the user focus on and click on what interests them — as long as they're thinking out loud, you may not need to ask many follow-up questions. If they ask questions about 18F, ask where they would look to find out more information.**

[If they go quiet, possible prompts include:]

- Ask about what they're looking for
- What interests you on this page?
- Where would you go from here?
- What would you do next?

Now that we've looked a bit through the website, what types of projects would you want 18F's help on?

Is there anything else that you would like to know before working with 18F? What concerns would you have about working with 18F?

Do you have any questions about 18F?

### Thank you (5 minutes)

We’re approaching 30 minutes, and I want to be respectful of your time. Do you have any questions for me?

We really appreciated and enjoyed this conversation. Your feedback is super valuable to our team. If you think of anything else you’d like to share, free to do so now or email me at anytime. Thank you again.
