Hi there! Thanks for agreeing to talk to me — I really appreciate it. My name is [X] and I’m joined by my colleagues [X]. You may already know this—we work for 18F a digital consultancy within GSA. Right now, we’re working on improving aspects of the 18F website.

The interview should take about 30 minutes. Do you have any questions?

Let’s get started.

Have you shared your screen on google hangouts before? Okay, you might want to close anything on your screen you don’t want me to see. [walk them through screen sharing]

### Walk through of site and prompt questions (15 minutes)

Could you start by telling me how you first found out about 18F?

In your own words, and there’s no right or wrong answer here. How would you describe 18F, and what we do?

Now looking at 18f.gsa.gov — if you could take a minute to look through this site while thinking out loud.
