# Sprint-KarstCaves research plan



## Goals & questions

Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Is the website communicating what we do? | How would you describe what 18F is and what they do?
 | What kinds of projects would you want 18F’s help on?
 | What else would you want to know before working with 18F?
Is the website building trust with potential partners within government? | Do you have any questions about 18F?
 | What concerns would you have about working with 18F?
Is the website content clear? | Highlight things that make you feel confident.
 | Highlight the things that are confusing to you.


## Background


## Methods

This research sprint will have 2 parts:

1. Overall usability testing to see how the site functions as a whole
    * 3-5 30 min interviews with federal employees at other agencies (or within GSA), all of whom should be somewhat unfamiliar with 18F
    * Notes and recordings
    * In-person or remote
2. Paper-prototype content testing to measure whether the content is clear
    * 3-5 in-person highlighting exercises with federal employees in DC, SF, or Denver
    * Recordings, if possible

We’ll work with 18F Agency Partnerships and friends of 18F to find contacts at other agencies.
