# Sprint 0 Research Results

## Background

We launched the new 18F website in August. This is the second round of research where we focused on talking to federal employees.

## Participants

* 3 participants who are federal employees at different agencies including Department of Defense and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.
* One participant was very familiar with 18F and the way that we work, but the other two were not.

## Methodology

We showed each participant the 18F website, and asked them to navigate the page and familiarize themselves with the information while thinking out loud.

## Findings

### Overall findings

* The two participants that were less familiar with 18F were confused by the hero, and suggest that it takes too much time to figure out what 18F does.
* Participants looked for clear reasons for why they should hire 18F.
* Participants expected much more information about entering into partnerships with 18F.



#### General feedback

- Three out of four users had difficulty getting back to the homepage from some of the pages and or guides.
- "_What we deliver We Help_ seems like a run on sentence."
- Users were expecting separate links to human-centered design, agile methodologies, and open source software. They were surprised that it was all one link to the playbook on the "how we work" page.
- None of the users clicked the links in the hero. (Hero is currently photo of cute celebrating the Every Kid in a Park project)
- One user expected to see a search box on the guides pages.

Both members of the tech community came to the site for guides, standards, definitions, open-source code, and resources to use at their companies. Both users also looked for and couldn't find shareable code or GitHub right away.

> "I’m always having to define accessibility for people. Might be nice to have that glossary available of special terms."
>
> "How do I hack how you’re doing it and bring that back to my company?"
>
> "Not doing anything to show that links go to external site. That’s interesting to me."


#### Unclear terms for federal employees

Homepage:
+ "Civic tech community" when you go to sign up for the newsletter.

What we deliver page:
+ "Discovery sprint."
+ "Agreements to produce better results - does not, to me, match with better and cheaper."
+ "User-centered design."
+ "Guides? Some people might get this, but I don't know what a lot of this is talking about."
+ "API."
+ "Some of this is very catchphrasy, like "scope of solution." How do I know what that means for me?

#### Positive feedback

- "The color scheme is nice and simple."
- "What we deliver is clear and concise at the bottom of the homepage."

## Conclusions

We should make sure it's easy for potential federal partners to understand the work that we do and how we might work with them by eliminating some of the more technical jargon.
