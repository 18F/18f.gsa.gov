# Sprint 0 Research Results

## Background

This is the second round of research and we're focused on talking to federal employees.

## Participants

* 3 participants who are federal employees at different agencies including Department of Defense and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.
* One participant was very familiar with 18F and the way that we work, but the other two were not.

## Methodology

We showed each participant the 18F website, and asked them to navigate the page and familiarize themselves with the information while thinking out loud.

## Findings

### Overall findings

* The two participants that were less familiar with 18F were confused by the hero, and suggest that it takes too much time to figure out what 18F does.
* Participants found many terms confusing.
* Participants want to know why they should hire 18F over someone else.
* Participants want more details about working with 18F, including costs of projects.

#### Specific feedback

- Develop a project size guide/example (what constitutes small, medium, and large), so that project managers could make an educated guess about their own project or idea.
- Tell us directly why we should come to 18F. *Highlight that!* Use adjectives.
- Show us the 18F team, and why they are the best people for the job.
- Put a phone number on your "hire us" page. In government, you have to be able to talk to a real person.
- Testimonials from partners especially would help if you’re trying to get more business. What have past partners said about your work?

Quotes:

> "There's no team page. What sort of people are on your teams? What is their background/experience? How do I know they are the right kind of people?""
>
> "When I am reading this (How we work), it might be an opportunity to say that you will join them in their desire to put the public first, and almost include them. We know that in your effort to put the public first. We are of one mind -- bring them along with you. "

#### Unclear terms for federal employees

Homepage:
+ "Civic tech community" when you go to sign up for the newsletter.

What we deliver page:
+ "Discovery sprint."
+ "Agreements to produce better results - does not, to me, match with better and cheaper."
+ "User-centered design."
+ "Guides? Some people might get this, but I don't know what a lot of this is talking about."
+ "API."
+ "Some of this is very catchphrasy, like "scope of solution." How do I know what that means for me?
+ I don’t know what those digital services are necessarily.

Hire us:
+ People have to apply to 18F? It's not necessarily hire 18F, we have to apply and pass your review.
+ You're helping people serve their public, you're not serving the public. You're not working for the public, you're working for the government.  
+ When I first saw _Hire 18F_, I thought that meant to join the team. I thought join was for potential partners.

#### Positive feedback

- "The color scheme is nice and simple."
- "What we deliver is clear and concise at the bottom of the homepage."

## Conclusions

We should make sure it's easy for potential federal partners to feel comfortable and confident reaching out to work with 18F with a project idea.
