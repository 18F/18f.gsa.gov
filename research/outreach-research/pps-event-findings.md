# Partnership for Public Service Tabling Event December 2, 2016. 

Purpose:  The Resource Fair segment of the three-day training will provide an opportunity for federal agencies to demonstrate their highest value community resources, tools, funding sources and training so that participants are familiarized with resources that will support and enhance their ability to assist communities. 

The outreach team tested new content and did a flashcard test to find out what issues agencies were facing. 

## Flashcards Test


Attendees were asked to point out from a group of cards the issues their agencies were facing regarding technology. The answers were as follows:


- Legacy systems: 4
- Outdated technology: 4
- Lack of knowledge sharing: 3
- Tansition to agile: 2
- Gathering requirements: 1
- Reaching the public: 1
- Communication strategy: 1
- Buying technology: 1


Another issue, not represented in the cards but shared by many, was showcasing/interpreting data. For example an attendee from EPA would like to be able to share radiation data with the public. Also attendees showed a great interest in USEITI when shown as an example on how data can be presented to the public.


## Taking Points Findings

Due to the nature of the event most participants did not share details on their issues and note taking was limited. Nevertheless those who were able to engage shared valuable information.


Legacy systems and outdated technology are issues shared by the majority of attendees. They feel their agencies need help upgrading their systems and finding ways to better reach the public.


Many attendees that spoke with us we're targeting a specific program in a region of the US and were searching for tools or guides on how to solve those issues. 


Examples of issues; 

- EPA: How to present radiation information about a specific city
- Labor: An app the helps veterans look for work in Boston
- HUD: Conduct a hackathon on creating resources in the LA area


Roughly spoke to 10 folks, and maybe about 20 picked up our fliers. 


The other programs tabling (HUD, National Endowment of the Arts, DOE, and Ed) all had resources that can help regional programs. They all were connected and familiar with each other. They all mentioned a Innovation Exchange webinar that OPM hosts on a monthly bases. There are about 840 folks on their listserv and about 200 who attend the webinar.
