# Research plan template

Before you start interviewing users, write up a research plan that communicates what you want to find out. Why should you do this? To make sure everyone involved in the research — including you, your team and the project stakeholders — has a shared understanding of what you want to find out and how you will go about doing it.

Write a one-page plan that covers the following: 

### Background

Describe the recent history of the project and what led you here. Be brief (no more than a paragraph).

> After a recent redesign we heard from users that they wanted to better understand what kind of projects we work on. The new site wasn’t clearly communicating that or whether we might be able to address their needs. We re-wrote the About Us page to better communicate what we do and now we want to know if it works better.

### Goals

State the high-level reason for conducting this study. Try to phrase it in one sentence. If you have more than two or three goals you won’t be able to cover them all in a single study. 

> Identify the strengths and weaknesses of the redesigned About Us page and identify opportunities for improvement.

### Research topics

The research topics are what you want to find out. They are not how you will phrase the actual questions. That’s what your test script (or moderator’s guide) is for. Aim for no more than about six topics. 

> 1. What questions do potential partners have about 18F?
> 2. Where do they go to answer these questions?
> 3. How well does the About Us page address them?

Be careful in selecting your research topics. Generally speaking, you’ll want to focus your research on learning more about your users (e.g., what their needs are, how they currently do a thing) or about your service (e.g., whether information on your site is findable, understandable, or meets your users’ needs.) You want to talk to them about their needs and **observe** their behavior. Do not ask them to **predict** their future behavior (e.g., “Would you be more likely to hire 18F as a result of reading this page?”). Remember, usability testing is all about watching what users do, not what they say they will do.

### Methods

Describe how you’re going to do the study: 

> We plan to conduct a remote usability study during the week of March 1 with up to eight participants recruited from a live intercept questionnaire on our home page. Each session will last around 30 minutes and will include a short interview, a few directed tasks using a prototype, and a debriefing. 

Once you have your research plan, make sure your team and any stakeholders review it to make sure everyone is aligned on the plan’s goals, research topics, and other details. Then you can get started writing your test script!

## Sample test script

At least five minutes before the call, test any equipment you’ll be using (sound, Google hangout, availability of your prototype, etc.). Make sure to include a dial-in to the hangout just in case the participant can’t get in.

#### Intro (5 min)

Hello! Thanks for agreeing to talk to me — I really appreciate it. My name is [X] and I’m joined by my colleagues [X]. We work for 18F, which is part of the General Services Administration. We recently redesigned our site and we want to make sure it works for the people who might use it. That’s where you come in! 

We’re going to start by asking about you and the work you do, then we’ll ask you to take a look at the 18F site and tell us if you have any feedback. Despite how it may feel at times, this is not a test of you or your knowledge of 18F. You're the expert! For the next half-hour, you can't be wrong. But if you find anything confusing, we really want to know about it so we can improve it. That said, your participation is totally voluntary and you’re free to end the interview at any time.

We'd like to take detailed notes, so we can share our findings with the rest of the team, but we won't attach your name to our synthesis. Is that okay with you?

*Note: If you are planning to audio or video record the session you MUST get the participant's permission. Talk to the Research Guild for any questions about this.*

Do you have any questions?

Okay! Let’s get started.

#### Icebreaker questions (5 min)

- Tell me a little about what you do: what's your job and how long have you been at your agency?
- What projects are you working on right now?
- What’s your biggest pain point on that project?
- What do you know about 18F? How did you learn about us?
- Do you have any questions about who we are or what we do?
  *Note: Don't answer these questions up front, but based on their answer this may make for a good self-directed task later.*

#### Site walkthrough (15 min)

[*If hangouts*] Have you shared your screen on google hangouts before? Okay, you might want to close anything on your screen you don’t want me to see. [*Walk them through screen sharing*]

- Okay, please go to 18f.gsa.gov. Let me know when you see the site.
- Take a minute to look through this site while thinking out loud.

*Let the user focus on and click on what interests them — as long as they're thinking out loud, you may not need to ask many follow-up questions. If they ask questions about 18F, ask where they would look to find out more information. If they go quiet, possible prompts include:*

- What are you looking for?
- Before you mentioned [question]. Have you seen anything here that answers your question?
- How would you paraphrase what you just read?

After they've spent a little time on the site, ask some further questions:

- Now that you've spent some time on the site, have you learned anything new? 
- Before you mentioned [pain point], have you seen anything about whether 18F could help with that? 
- Let’s say you [decided to work / found out your team would be working] with 18F. Is there anything else that you would like to know before working with 18F? What concerns would you have about working with 18F?
- Do you have any questions about 18F that haven’t been answered by the website?

#### Debrief (5 min)

- How did that work for you?
- Our goal for the redesign was to make it easier for potential partners to understand what kind of work we do. How’d we do? 
- What should we change about the prototype to make it more useful? 
- Do you have any other feedback for us?

We really appreciate your time and feedback. If you think of anything else you’d like to share, free to do so now or email me at anytime. Thanks again.

## Analysis

The next thing you’ll want to do is figure out what was important about what you saw and heard. Take a few minutes immediately after the session to write down the three to six most important things that came up. If anyone else observed the session, have them do the same thing and compare notes. If you keep a running tally of these, it’ll make analysis at the end of the study that much easier. 

Focus on findings that are actionable. In other words, things that you can do something about. For example:

> 1. People still don’t realize 18F is part of the federal government; they think we’re a vendor.
> 2. Peers at other agencies are visiting the site to learn more about how we do things and to see how to incorporate our methods in their own work, not to decide whether to hire us.

When you start hearing the same issues over and over, or stop hearing about new problems, it’s probably time to stop this round of research.
