# Sprint-PrecipitousPingo update

After our last three research sprints, we made recommendations about the Hire 18F page, including:

> We should make sure it's easy for potential federal partners to feel comfortable and confident reaching out to work with 18F with a project idea.

> Clarify the intake process and tell people what to expect after emailing 18F.

> Clarify the call to action: invite users to contact us with inquiries.
> 
> Hypotheses:
> 
> - Making the call to action clearer will result in more inquiries.
> - Removing language about "limited resources" will result in more inquiries.

As a result, we [revised the Hire 18F page](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/releases/tag/1.1.2) to be more welcoming, tell people who they're contacting (Dan Kenny), and include a pre-populated template in the `mailto` link.

During this sprint, we checked in with the Agency Partnerships team, which responds to emails to the `inquiries18f@gsa.gov` address.

We asked (via Slack):

> Have you-all gotten any feedback on the new `Hire 18F` page or intake email button?

We heard back:

> it does make the initial convo a little smoother now that they have a name

> the changes have definitely helped a lot because we have that background information when we meet clients so calls are more focused on their needs

> They have [filled out the prompts in the email]! The intake emails we're getting now have been a lot more thorough than before, and people have been very receptive to the "Tell us a little about the problems you're working on, or what project you're hoping to work on with 18F" prompt

In the emails Dan shared, there are a few patterns:

- Some people combine the agency/office and job title questions by pasting in their email signature
- Not everyone uses the template, though it's a little unclear whether those who didn't use it were coming through the website or had gotten the inquiries address elsewhere

## Analytics

During the period from 12/9/2016-1/8/2017, fewer visitors used mailto links to email `18f@gsa.gov` from the website (down from 52 to 21), but — despite the holidays — more visitors used mailto links to email `inquiries18f@gsa.gov`. This _could_ mean that our new Hire page is more approachable!
