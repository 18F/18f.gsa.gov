Developer Resources
===================

<p class="lead">We hope that developers everywhere make use of the APIs we build for our projects.  Over time, you'll find a growing number of APIs listed here, along with resources and documentation to assist with their use.</p>


##18F APIs

###FBOpen

The [FBOpen API](https://18f.github.io/fbopen/) is a search index of opportunities to work with the U.S. Government.  Learn more from the [launch announcement](http://18fblog.tumblr.com/post/81293178801/announcing-fbopen-government-opportunities-made-easier) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/18f/fbopen). You can also view the live front-end interface built on the API at [fbopen.gsa.gov](https://fbopen.gsa.gov).


##18F Initiatives

###/Developer Program

The [/Developer Program](http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/) is a suite of tools and resources to assist in the production and management of government APIs.  The information is available to all and can be readily repurposed to the needs of individual agencies.  Furthermore, the program includes various options for direct support which are available to any federal agency. Learn more from the [blog post announcing the program](http://18fblog.tumblr.com/post/87233336788/announcing-the-developer-program-a-new-hub-for).

###api.data.gov

[api.data.gov](http://api.data.gov) is a free API management service for federal agencies.  It provides an API with analytics, a proxy layer, and an API key solution.

###API Standards

The 18F [API Standards](https://github.com/18f/api-standards) is a living document that serves as internal guidance for our developers as they build web services.  We also want our partners to better anticipate how 18F projects operate.  Please [suggest improvements](https://github.com/18f/api-standards/issues) as we are always looking to improve our practices.

###Open Source Policy

The 18F [Open Source Policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy) dictates our procedures when developing projects â€” both in how our team operates and how it interacts with the wider community.  We believe that working in the open makes for better products.  This policy is a living document, so please [suggest improvements](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/issues).
