# What we deliver

What we deliver are solutions to your problems. The first step in that
process is always a thorough exploration of the challenges facing your
agency and your users, but the solution can be found down any number of
different paths. The constant is that 18F will gather the right experts
for the job, work hand-in-hand with your team, use modern techniques,
and talk with real users throughout the process to make sure we’re
building the right thing, not just any thing.

To get started, here’s a broad outline of what we deliver and some
solutions we’ve created with our partners.

## Custom products to solve your problems

If your agency’s project has a digital component, 18F’s team of software
developers, visual designers, writers, and security experts can help you
build it. We can also help ensure that you are set up to get the most
value out of the solutions we offer. We can help you:

-   Improve a challenging user process by reimagining a daunting task, as we did with the [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service](https://my.uscis.gov/) and their immigration and visa processes
-   Build a new site and API to showcase and synthesize data from multiple sources, as we did with Department of Education's [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)
-   Help you make your data more accessible with a user-friendly site and developer tools, as we did with the [Federal Election Commission](https://beta.fec.gov/)
-   Build web-based tools to streamline internal agency processes, as we did with [Communicart](https://cap.18f.gov/) and [CALC](https://calc.gsa.gov/)
-   Scope a solution or collaborate on an idea in a way that empowers you to meet the needs of your users, as we did with the [Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/09/how-a-two-day-spring-moved-an-agency-twenty-years-forward/)
-   Do user research and discovery sprints to promote a new digital model that houses information, as we did with NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Discovery project

## Innovative ways to buy technology

We believe federal IT acquisitions can be faster, cheaper, and produce
better results. If your agency is developing a new request for quotation
for IT services or is interested in innovative ways to buy technology,
our team is excited to work with you. We can help you:

-   Write agile, modular, and user-centered design into your request for quotations through our RFP Ghostwriting service, like we did with the [Department of Health and Human Services](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/03/22/helping-california-buy-a-new-child-welfare-system/).
-   Develop a marketplace to buy IT services using modern techniques, like we did with the [Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement](https://pages.18f.gov/ads-bpa/).
-   Buy small pieces of open source code to advance your projects, like we’re doing with our [micro-purchase platform](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/).

## Platforms built for government

Federal agencies face a unique set of technology problems. We’re
building a suite of secure, scalable tools and platforms that any agency
can use to solve these common problems. Our platforms are built with the
needs of government addressed right at the beginning and are being
actively improved to meet your needs. We can help you:

-   Host your applications in the cloud with our [cloud.gov platform](https://cloud.gov/).
-   Build customizable and easy-to-maintain static sites with the [Federalist platform](https://federalist.18f.gov/).
-   Release and manage your API with [api.data.gov](https://api.data.gov/).

## A path to becoming a digitally-powered organization

We can embed a fully-dedicated 18F team within your agency to work
hand-in-hand with you to increase your internal digital capacity, help
you form new digital habits, and ultimately drive organizational culture change. We can help you:

-   Attract, empower, and grow your own digital team.
-   Adopt a DevOps culture and begin a transition to the cloud.
-   Institute lean-agile practices, including agile acquisitions.
-   Establish a model to modernize your legacy systems.

## Modern digital service techniques

We can provide your team with the skills and knowledge they need to
modernize your agency’s digital services. We’ve also built a number of
knowledge-sharing and documentation tools for 18F’s own use that you can
copy and use at your agency. We can help you:

-   Run a workshop on agile software development, like the [Lego workshop we did with the Small Business Administration](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/08/31/how-playing-with-legos-taught-executives-agile/) or the longer one we did with the [Social Security Administration](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/02/11/a-story-of-an-agile-workshop/).
-   Host a design studio, like we did with the [Department of the Interior](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/09/25/design-studio-onrr/).
-   Create your own lightweight knowledge sharing platform based off 18F’s [Guides](https://pages.18f.gov/guides-template/) and [Pages](https://pages.18f.gov/) projects.

# How we work
<br/>
We find our way through every project by putting the needs of the public
first. We use [human-centered design, agile methodologies, and open
source software](https://playbook.cio.gov/) to build world-class digital services for the American
public. We’re committed to working in the open, building accessible
products, and deploying early and often.

See exactly how we put all of those principles into practice by reading
through our guides on [accessibility](https://pages.18f.gov/accessibility/),
[CSS coding style](https://pages.18f.gov/frontend/css-coding-styleguide/), [open source projects](https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/), [content](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/), [lean product design](https://pages.18f.gov/lean-product-design/),
and [more](https://pages.18f.gov/guides/). We’re public about the standards we use, and we publish any
guidance we create for our staff.
