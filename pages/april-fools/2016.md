For April Fools Day 2016, 18F added several new team members for the day.
They ranged from individuals responsible for founding the country to
important figures in computing history to fictional characters the team
takes inspiration from. They were:
<div class="blog-posting">
{% assign fools = site.team | where:'april-fools', '2016' %}
{% for fool in fools %}
<div class="pquote">
    {{ fool.name | team_photo }}
    <blockquote>
      <h3>{{ fool.full_name }}</h3>
      <h4>{{ fool.city}}, {{ fool.state }}</h4>
    </blockquote>
</div>
<p>{{ fool.joke }}</p>
<hr>
{% endfor %}
</div>

We also sent [several
tweets](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3A18F%20since%3A2016-04-01%20until%3A2016-04-02&src=typd) to welcome our new team members aboard.
