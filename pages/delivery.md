<h1 style= "padding-top: 64px;"> 18F Delivery</h1>

Delivery is our flagship business, the core of everything we do. A talented group of developers, designers, writers, and project managers work in agile teams to build world-class digital services. We rethink the way government services are built and put the needs of the public first. We accomplish this through our core values:

- Building excellent teams of technologists
- Deploying new services early and often
- Being open, agile, design centric, and data driven

## Open
We believe software should be well designed from the first line of code, and designing in the open keeps us responsive to user feedback. We celebrate public contributions to our projects.

The federal government faces large, complicated problems; open source allows us to share our strategies for tackling them. And once we’ve addressed an issue, anyone else can take our work and adapt it. As an example, the city of [Philadelphia](http://phillyinnovates.com/2015/04/20/toward-unified-digital-analytics/) modified our project, [analytics.usa.gov](http://analytics.usa.gov), to create their own [analytics site](http://analytics.phila.gov/). 

## Agile
Agile can mean a lot of things. For us, it means building something small enough to address a well-defined need in a short timespan. It also means allowing the team to adjust their focus if user or agency feedback suggests we're on the wrong track. 

Deadlines can change. Needs can change. We make our teams flexible enough to always deliver something high quality and high value. Developing, standing up, and sharing with users a minimally viable product — one that isn’t fully functional — is a key component of what we do. This allows us to gather feedback and make edits before a product is finalized.

## Design centric and data driven
User experience and usability research is embedded into our projects from the start. We want to build the right thing, not just anything. Accomplishing this means speaking to users regularly and having them test our work as often as possible. 

Our developers, designers, and project managers work side-by-side with researchers to understand the impact of our design decisions. Our product teams care about usability and are often found alongside user-experience researchers testing versions of our products to understand how people interact with them.
