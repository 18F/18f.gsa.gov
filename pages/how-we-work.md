## Path Analysis:
### Asking the right questions, solving the right problems.
{: .hww-subheading}

Each Path Analysis is customized to the needs of an agency, with the goal of moving you from identifying a problem to working on a solution. With a Path Analysis, we’ll develop an action-oriented analysis of routes to pursue, places to narrow the project's scope, and the best ways to deliver value to your users.

## Experiment & Iterate:
### Exploring user-centered solutions.
{: .hww-subheading}

Once your team has completed a Path Analysis, we can experiment and iterate on a solution to your problem. An 18F team will work shoulder-to-shoulder with your team to explore the challenges your users face and develop solutions to those problems. Experiment & Iterate phases can focus on building a working product, preparing a procurement package, or training your team to take over development. This model allows you to stay in control of your budget and remain flexible.
