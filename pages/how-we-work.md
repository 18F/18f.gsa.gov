### Transform the way you work

Because [87% of large government IT projects fail](https://derisking-guide.18f.gov/), government’s approach to this work needs to change. We believe that projects have the best chance for success when agency leaders and staff themselves are closely involved in developing the solutions they need. We can help.

## Ask the right questions, solve the right problems
{: .hww-subheading}

We take the time and have the experience to understand the specific mission of your organization. In an 18F engagement, we work together to understand what problem you need to solve. 

18F has [deep expertise in _talking to people_](https://18f.gov/guides). When you talk to users and staff, you get to the heart of the problem by learning how people use your services and technology. That's how we uncover insights and find new solutions.

## Choose the path that’s best for your mission and your users

### Exploring user-centered solutions.
{: .hww-subheading}

We don’t offer one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, we work with you to design the right path for your organization and ensure that you feel confident about each step. We believe in “demos not memos” and everything we do is intended to be a step toward working software.

Some software projects are the right size and shape for 18F to build with you; others will require you to hire an outside vendor. We can help you to hire a vendor that can respond to your changing needs and deliver working software to you on a regular basis.

## Tech that adapts and grows with your needs

{: .hww-subheading}

18F engagements are designed to end. Since we're part of the federal government, we don't have a vested interest in extending engagements unnecessarily or selling you things you don't need. 

Instead, we involve your team in creating solutions and ensure they have everything they need to maintain and improve systems long after we're gone.

## Acquisitions Services

Our acquisition team specializes in modern information technology – IT modernization, legacy system upgrades, software development services, and cloud services (SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS).  Our approach allows you to structure your contracts for modern software development—such as agile development— which reduces risk, increases flexibility, and awards contracts faster and **to the most** qualified industry partner(s). Members of the 18F cross-disciplinary team, which may include designers, developers, product managers, and acquisition experts, will support you throughout the lifecycle of the procurement.

## Acquisition Consulting

### Coaching your team through the procurement process.
{: .hww-subheading}

Your contracting officer will conduct the procurement with guidance and coaching from our team. We will work with your team to:

-   Conduct user research and discovery
-   Develop the procurement package and any necessary justification materials
-   Conduct a three-day acquisition workshop to draft a solicitation
-   Assist with market research, help identify qualified contractors, support Q&A, serve as advisors to the evaluation panel, and support the contractor kick-off meeting.
-   De-risk the procurement through prototyping
-   Support the contractor kick-off meeting

18F can also provide post-award support for additional fees.

## Assisted Acquisition

### Managing the procurement process for your team.
{: .hww-subheading}

18F will conduct the procurement and issue an award using a GSA/FAS procurement vehicle. Assisted acquisition includes all the consulting acquisition offerings, plus:

-   Conduct market research, solicit industry, conduct Q&A, evaluate proposals/bids, award the contract, and facilitate the contractor kick-off meeting.
-   Provide post-award management and support, which includes training your team to direct the vendor team, assess the work, and get into production

In each of our projects, our teams will work to build your agency’s capacity for agile digital service delivery. We’ll empower your team to continue to do this work beyond our engagement.
