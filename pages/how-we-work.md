### 18F partners with civilian and military federal agencies to help you build or buy exceptional digital services.

18F helps agencies define a strategy and work towards a solution through our Path Analysis and Experiment and Iterate services. We also offer procurement services, including to state and local governments with access to federal funds.

18F works with partners that have federal funding, and, as a cost recoverable office, we’re required to charge for our work.

## Path Analysis:
### Asking the right questions, solving the right problems.
{: .hww-subheading}

Each Path Analysis is customized to the needs of an agency, with the goal of moving you from identifying a problem to working on a solution. With a Path Analysis, we’ll develop an action-oriented analysis of routes to pursue, places to narrow the project's scope, and the best ways to deliver value to your users.

## Experiment & Iterate:
### Exploring user-centered solutions.
{: .hww-subheading}

Once your team has completed a Path Analysis, we can experiment and iterate on a solution to your problem. We'll work shoulder-to-shoulder with your team to explore the challenges your users face and develop solutions to those problems. Experiment & Iterate phases can focus on building a working product, preparing a procurement package, or training your team to take over development. This model allows you to stay in control of your budget and remain flexible.

We’ll start with a Path Analysis and move directly to an Experiment & Iterate phase (both described above) as soon as possible. With this bundle option, we are able to more flexibly move between the phases of the project, without losing momentum.
