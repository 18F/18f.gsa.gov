## Path Analysis:
### Asking the right questions, solving the right problems.
{: .hww-subheading}

18F can help you make an informed, confident decision about how to address your technology problems. With a Path Analysis, we’ll develop an action-oriented analysis of routes to pursue, places to narrow the project's scope, and the best ways to deliver value to your users. Each Path Analysis is customized to the needs of an agency, with the goal of moving you from identifying a problem to working on a solution.

## Experiment & Iterate:
### Exploring user-centered solutions.
{: .hww-subheading}

Once your team has completed a Path Analysis, we can experiment and iterate on a solution to your problem. An 18F team will work shoulder-to-shoulder with your team to explore the challenges your users face and develop solutions to those problems. Experiment & Iterate phases can focus on investigating user needs, building a working product, or preparing your team to take over development. This model allows you to stay in control of your budget and remain flexible.
