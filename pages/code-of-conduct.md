# The Technology Transformation Services (TTS) Code of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct is designed to summarize federal anti-harassment law and General Services Administration policy in order to promote a culture of inclusion and respect. Itâ€™s currently undergoing internal review and will be posted publicly as soon as possible. In the meantime, we ask our guests to remember that TTS is a workplace. We expect everyone, including our guests, to conduct themselves according to relevant laws and agency policies regarding workplace harassment and discrimination.
