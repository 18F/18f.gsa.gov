    quote="18F helped accelerate modernization of waterdata.usgs.gov, which has been serving real-time water data since 1995! The techniques we learned from 18F have become embedded in our software development approach. When we first started working with 18F, I didn’t realize how profound the impact would be on our team. I thought we just needed some knowledge transfer... We’ve embedded these methods into our software development to reduce the risk of IT investment and learn more about users and technology."
