We are an office within the [Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/tts/) (TTS), which is part of the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) (GSA). We help other government agencies build, buy, or share technology products.

We've worked with over 50 offices and agencies, on more than 200 engagements. All our projects support agencies in transforming how they deliver digital services and technology products.

Our team is made up of about 200 designers, software engineers, strategists, and product managers — all federal employees. We have offices in DC, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York, as well as team members working remotely from all over the country.

## Our principles

We strive to work in a modern way and use best practices on all our projects. Here's what that means to us:

[PURTY LOGO?] **Human-centered design:** Our projects are by the people, for the people. Everything is designed with the end user in mind. We listen to real users to understand their needs and build things that will be useful to them.

[PURTY LOGO?] **Agile:** We’re iterative and experimental. As we work, we pay careful attention to what succeeds — and what doesn't. We quantify our work with metrics and feedback, which, in turn, informs our thinking and our next round of building.

[PURTY LOGO?] **Open:** Our projects are designed and built in public. That means open source, open data, and open APIs. Working transparently helps us develop faster, make better decisions, provide code for many others to reuse, and keep costs low.

## History and name

In March 2014, a group of Presidential Innovation Fellows started 18F to extend their efforts to improve and modernize government technology. In 2016, GSA created the Technology Transformation Service to bring together 18F, the [Presidential Innovation Fellows program](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/), the Office of Acquisitions, and the [Office of Products and Programs](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/124174) (formerly the Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies).

**What does 18F mean?** Our name is short for the address of the GSA building where we're headquartered in Washington, DC: 1800 F Street.

## Funding

We are cost-recoverable, which means we don't receive appropriated funds from Congress and must charge partner agencies for our work. There are two authorities we use to recover costs:

- Acquisition Services Fund (ASF) reimbursement authority: for work related to acquisitions
- [Economy Act (PDF)](http://www.gc.noaa.gov/documents/mou-economyact.pdf) reimbursement authority: for projects that cannot use ASF reimbursement authority

We use [Interagency Agreements](https://pages.18f.gov/iaa-forms/) (IAAs) to set up the terms of our projects, and bill partners through [Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsservices/gov/acctg/ipac/ipac_home.htm) (IPAC) on a monthly basis.
