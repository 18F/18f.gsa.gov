We include links to information created and maintained by third-parties. When you click a link to a website, the privacy and security policies of that website apply. Non-federal websites do not necessarily operate under the same laws, regulations, and policies as federal websites.

We choose links consistent with sound public policy and that support the mission of 18F, GSA, and its programs. Also, if we have a formal relationship with organizations or businesses, we may link to their sites.

The inclusion of links is not intended to assign importance to those sites or to the information contained on those sites. Regardless of content that we link to from our sites or our social media accounts, we do not endorse any commercial product, service, process, or enterprise. We link to other websites and refer to commercial products or enterprises solely for your convenience and education. We cannot assume any responsibility for the content, operation, or policies of other websites.

We will not link to any website that exhibits hate, bias, or discrimination.
