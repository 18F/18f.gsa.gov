# 18F Consulting: Understand. Acquire. Deliver.

Building new digital services or improving old ones can be risky, complex, and expensive. Doing it well can solve real problems, improve people’s lives, save taxpayer money, and improve the way government works.

18F Consulting helps federal agencies adopt modern approaches to managing and delivering digital services. We are federal employees, like you. But we are also a team of designers, product strategists, architects, and acquisition specialists, with wide-ranging experience inside and outside of the federal government. Whether you are a program manager, a contracting officer, a lawyer, or a CIO, we’ll partner with you to set you up for success.

## What should you build, buy, or change?

Too often, teams tasked with solving a problem don’t know where to begin, or get locked into an idea too soon. 18F Consulting helps you understand your audiences using human-centered design principles. Early on, we help you discover the options (e.g., product strategy, new technology, acquisition) available to you so your initiative will succeed.

## How should you do it?

We advocate and guide you through proven practices in human-centered design, lean startup, Agile architecture, Agile development, open data, and DevOps. These industry-standard techniques increase the likelihood of your next initiative succeeding. 

## Who should do it?

Procuring the right team through an outside vendor or recruiting that talent in-house are key to producing high-quality digital services. We understand how federal acquisition and hiring processes have long been barriers to success, not a core part of a digital strategy. We use every tool in our toolkit to help change that, to make getting the right people a priority, and to help you hold them accountable for their work. Let us help you develop a strategy for soliciting and on boarding vendors and design or technology hires for your project or organization, and help you manage their performance.
