Thank you for participating in the RFP-EZ pilot.
===================

RFP-EZ is not currently accepting new projects or users.

Your feedback about the RFP-EZ pilot has been invaluable in informing 18F's next generation of innovative procurement tools and services, including:

* The [**Agile Delivery Services Marketplace**](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/08/creating-a-federal-marketplace-for-agile-delivery-services/) is a government-wide vehicle featuring vendors who specialize in agile software development. Read about the introductory [Industry Day event](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/02/12/highlights-from-the-agile-delivery-services-industry-day-events/) (the most widely attended in GSA history!).

* [**FBOpen**](https://fbopen.gsa.gov) is a simple search interface for finding opportunities to do business with the U.S. Government. The website is built on the [FBOpen API](https://18f.github.io/fbopen/), which is free to use. Learn more from the [launch announcement](http://18fblog.tumblr.com/post/81293178801/announcing-fbopen-government-opportunities-made-easier) and the [FBOpen repository on GitHub](https://github.com/18f/fbopen).

* [**Discovery**](https://discovery.gsa.gov) is a market research tool for contract specialists purchasing on the [GSA OASIS procurement vehicle](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/161367).

* **SBIR-EZ** will simplify the experience of participating in the Small Business Innovation Research Program. Learn more at the [Air Force SBIR-EZ repository on GitHub](https://github.com/18F/afsbirez).
