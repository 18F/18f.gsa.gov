Since the initiative launched two years ago, Presidential Innovation Fellows, along with their government teammates, have been delivering impressive resultsâ€”at start-up velocity. Fellows have unleashed the power of open government data to spur the creation of new products and jobs; improved the ability of the Federal government to respond effectively to natural disasters; designed pilot projects that make it easier for new economy companies to do business with the Federal Government; and much more.

Fellows have partnered with leaders and change makers at more than 20 government agencies, and have helped drive some extraordinary work and innovative solutions in concert with their Federal partners, in areas like Open Data, Platforms, and Crowdsourcing.
