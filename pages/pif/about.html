<h2>{{page.title}}</h2>

<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program was established by the White House in 2012 to attract top innovators into government, capable of tackling issues at the convergence of technology, policy, and process.</p>

<p>The PIF program is administered as a partnership between the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the General Services Administration (GSA).   In 2013, the PIF program established a permanent home and program office within GSA, where it operates as part of 18F, an innovative group focused on the delivery of digital services across the federal government.</p>

<h3>Program Details</h3>
<br>
<p>The Fellowship is a 12-month program, during which Fellows are embedded within a federal agency to collaborate on challenges with innovators inside government.  Fellows are based in Washington D.C. for the duration of their Fellowship, and are considered full-time employees of the federal government.</p>

<p>Fellows operate with wide latitude for individual initiative in planning and executing solutions to problem, and spend a significant portion of their time co-working and collaborating with other Fellows.  Throughout the program, Fellows receive support from partners in the White House and change-agents across various federal agencies.</p>

<p>Fellows have unleashed the power of open government data to spur the creation of new products and jobs; improved the ability of the Federal government to respond effectively to natural disasters; designed pilot projects that make it easier for new economy companies to do business with the Federal Government; and much more.</p>
