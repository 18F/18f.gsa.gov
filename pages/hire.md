Have a project in mind? Want to see if 18F can help your agency? Get in touch, and we'll set up a time to talk:

You can also email our Agency Partnerships team directly at [inquiries18F@gsa.gov](mailto:inquiries18F@gsa.gov).

Once we've worked together to define your problem, we can help you build or buy a solution. You can read more about how we work with agencies in our [Partnership Playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/partnership-playbook/).

18F is a cost-recoverable office, which means we don't receive appropriated funds from Congress and must charge our partner agencies to cover our costs. We use [Interagency Agreements](https://pages.18f.gov/iaa-forms/) to set up the terms of our projects.
