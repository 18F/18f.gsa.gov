### How we work with partners

We’ll set up a time to talk more, answer your questions, and ask about what you have in mind. Once we understand your office and the problems you're trying to solve, we'll figure out whether we can help you build or buy a solution.

### How we are funded

18F is a cost-recoverable office, which means we don't receive appropriated funds from Congress and must charge our partner agencies for the work we do. We use [Interagency Agreements](https://pages.18f.gov/iaa-forms/) to set up the terms of our projects.

You can read more about how we work with agencies in our [Partnership Playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/partnership-playbook/).
