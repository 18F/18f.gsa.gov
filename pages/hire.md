# Hire 18F

18F is available for short- and long-term engagements with federal
agencies, the D.C. government, and to assist with projects that receive
federal grants to state and local agencies. We can work with you to
explore and define a variety of problems, and then we can help you build
or buy a solution.

Because of our limited resources, 18F is not able to take on every
project that agencies propose. We select our projects through a
qualification and evaluation process led by our Agency Partnerships
Team. If you and 18F decide that we’re the right fit for a project and
we have the necessary time and resources, we’ll work with you to draft
the necessary documents to begin our partnership. You can read more
about how we work with other agencies in our [Partnership
Playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/partnership-playbook/).

18F is a cost-recoverable office, which means that we do not receive
appropriated funds from Congress and must charge our partner agencies to
cover our costs. Funding is set up through [Interagency
Agreements](https://pages.18f.gov/iaa-forms/).
