## How we work with partners

18F is a cost-recoverable office, which means we don't receive appropriated funds from Congress and must charge our partner agencies to cover our costs. We use [Interagency Agreements](https://pages.18f.gov/iaa-forms/) to set up the terms of our projects.

You can read more about how we work with agencies in our [Partnership Playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/partnership-playbook/).
