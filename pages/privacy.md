18F is a component of the [General Services Administration](http://gsa.gov) (GSA), an independent agency of the United States federal government.

As such, this website is currently covered by the [GSA's overall privacy policy](http://gsa.gov/portal/content/116609).


## Third Party Services

Serving this website relies on several third party services, each of whom may obtain data concerning some aspects of your browsing history on this website.

The third party services we use are quite common on the internet today, and you almost certainly visit other websites using them on a regular basis. In the spirit of transparency and an informed public, we're listing them here.

Feel free to [open a discussion](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/issues) with any issues or suggestions about the information on this page.

<hr/>

* **[Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/).** 18F uses analytics on its website to understand visitor behavior. We instruct Google to [anonymize visitor IP addresses](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en) before they are stored. We submit analytics to two Google Analytics accounts: our own, and one belonging to the federal government's [Digital Analytics Program](https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/).

* **[Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/).** 18F uses free webfonts from Google to style our website.

* **[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com).** 18F's website is served by Amazon's commercial cloud hosting services.

* **[Symantec](https://www.symantec.com).** 18F protects your browsing data using an [encrypted HTTPS connection](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/11/13/why-we-use-https-in-every-gov-website-we-make/). We currently use a HTTPS "certificate" from Symantec. Some browsers ask Symantec for confirmation of our certificate before loading our website, which tells Symantec you've visited our site. We are [working on improving this process](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/issues/292) so that most browsers will no longer share visitor information with Symantec.
