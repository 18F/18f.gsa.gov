The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) .gov registry manages the .gov top-level domain. Together we built a new way to request and manage .gov domains. The project included three phases and went from discovery to build to launch. 

### Approach

**User-centered design**: We conducted user research during each phase of this project. We talked to existing .gov domain managers, eligible domain managers, and stakeholders. Team members from all disciplines participated in user interviews and usability sessions. 

**Transparency**: The registrar we developed is open source. [Follow the work on GitHub](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov).

**Agile development**: We practiced agile development to continually improve our product. We operated on a two-week sprint cycle. We released improvements to production a few times per week. We conducted sprint planning, retros, and backlog refinement sessions. 

We acquired the services of an excellent, agile software development team to work with an existing federal team. The vendor team worked in an incremental manner and delivered solid code that served user needs.

**Empowered product owner**: Our federal product owner had the authority to speak for the .gov program, communicate directly with users, make decisions, prioritize, assign work, and hire staff. 

### Outcomes

**Open-source registrar**: We built and launched an open-source registrar, the home for .gov domains. The registrar is where governments request and manage .gov domains. We put the domain request process online (no more physical signatures required). The new registrar sets the stage for future features, like DNS hosting. 

**Registry provider**: We transitioned the .gov registry (which contains domain names and registrant information for .gov) to a new service provider. 

**Get.gov public site**: We built and launched [get.gov, a new public website](https://get.gov/) to help eligible organizations request and manage .gov domains.

**Support for the .gov team**: We built and launched an internal system for .gov analysts to manage domain requests and support domain managers.

**Agile development**: We built a user-centered, agile, cross-disciplinary team that included federal government and vendor staff.
