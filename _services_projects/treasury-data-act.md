The Department of the Treasury manages the $3.8 trillion spent by the U.S. federal government every year. For most people, itâ€™s difficult to know exactly where that money goes.

Congress passed the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) of 2014 to help the public better understand how federal money is spent. The DATA Act requires federal agencies to adopt a common data standard. Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget led the implementation of the DATA Act. They needed help developing the new data standard and planning for its technical implementation.

### Approach
* Together with our partner we built a prototype for ingesting and presenting data. This allowed us to get user feedback before the data standard was final. 
* We developed a procurement strategy to make sure Treasury hired a qualified vendor.
* We conducted user research on a new site design.
* Informed by the prototype and user-centered design, the vendor built [USAspending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/).

### Outcomes

* Our iterative approach allowed Treasury to reduce risk, use actual data to make decisions, and speed up implementation of a very complex law.
* The site gives the public powerful tools to examine federal spending. 
* DATA Act implementation is one of the largest government-wide agile projects ever undertaken. The new tool ingests information from across the government.
* 18F provided the development expertise, procurement strategy and product management to ensure a successful project.
